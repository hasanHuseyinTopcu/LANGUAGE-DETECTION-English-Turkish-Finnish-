I wish I was back in high school for this one:   urlLink Wireless Networking for the TI graphing calculators .  Back in high school, our graphing calculators full of games saved some of our sanity.  We went so far as to create Tetris tournaments.  I went so far as to create games in BASIC for the TI-85, then to learn assembly for the TI-92.  I never did get enough knowledge of the TI-92 to create games, but that knowledge did help me out with my college course in assembly.
urlLink Mac OS 9 versus Corel Linux ?  At first, this "Death Match" made no sense at all.  After reading the article, it still makes no sense at all but did a good job of explaining the abilities of these  alternative  OSs.

I can smell her now. The scent is reminiscent of a powder. Not baby powder, but a dry, mute aroma. A floral accent is present, similar to lilacs yet not as pungent. Before this, I only had one visual. The setting is always the same. Nighttime turns red to grey and yellow to white. She stands softly with her back to a wall of windows, covered mostly with draperies. It seems to be our bedroom. The visual of her is the strongest. Long, straight hair frames her oval face, giving her an intelligent air. The color black is an understatement, for her raven hair is so dark it is translucent. The contrast to her pale skin is remarkable. Though barely visible in the moonlight, her eyes burn with a comfortable evil. She is definitely my equal. Her attire is still a bit hazy. The Japanese aspects of my psyche scream out kimono, yet it could just be a simple shapeless dress she is wearing. The setting speaks that we are home for the night, or we could have just gotten home. There are many things I know, yet questions still remain. Her emotion toward me has two possibilities; she is either upset and concerned about something between us, or she has a joy in her heart boundless. The year I turn 22 is pivotal, but is it because we meet this year, or because we get married in that year?  These images and soothsay swirl in my mind as a mist, never to be grasped.
To counteract my actions of snobbery, my monitor decided that it really really liked Yellow.  Trying to view the net in shades of yellow will kill your eyesight for at least an hour for every 5 minutes of surfing.  It was a nice flat screen 17 inch NEC, but I got it used without a warranty.  $350 will disappear from my wallet soon.  I am currently using a 14'' POS, and 14 inches is not enough to satisfy.

The following concerns a question in a physics degree exam at the University of Copenhagen:
"Describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with a barometer."
One student replied:
"You tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer, then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the ground. The length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building."
This highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the student was failed immediately. The student appealed on the grounds that his answer was indisputably correct, and the university appointed an independent arbiter to decide the case.
The arbiter judged that the answer was indeed correct, but did not display any noticeable knowledge of physics. To resolve the problem it was decided to call the student in and allow him six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer which showed at least a minimal familiarity with the basic principles of physics.
For five minutes the student sat in silence, forehead creased in thought. The arbiter reminded him that time was running out, to which the student replied that he had several extremely relevant answers, but couldn't make up his mind which to use. On being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows:
"Firstly, you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper, drop it over the edge, and measure the time it takes to reach the ground. The height of the building can then be worked out from the formula H = 0.5g x t squared. But bad luck on the barometer."
"Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer, then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow. Then you measure the length of the skyscraper's shadow, and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper."
"But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum, first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper. The height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force T = 2 pi sqrroot (l / g)."
"Or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths, then add them up."
"If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of course, you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground, and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building."
"But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say to him 'If you would like a nice new barometer, I will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper'."
The student was Niels Bohr, the only Dane to win the Nobel prize for Physics.

The word of the day is  conduit .   Why?  It sounds cool.
Conduit: con\B7duit (n.)  A means by which something is transmitted
The word of the day is used in the song Get Off by Bad Religion:
Lascivious, it's all that I can think of as I drag my feet,
searching like a diogenes,
dangerous, the adjectives of the decade
and of your alluring intricacies,
I can see your green-screen mentality
and I can feel the sting of it's consequence,
and I know I shouldn't
but it's too much to ignore, an emotion I deplore,
every time I look at you,
I just want do it,
I can clench my fist right through it
but I just want to get off
rectilinear, this direction we've been heading
never realizing we are on a runaway machine,
angular, the momentum that does turn us one
step further on our ladder,
one more turn toward the east,
I realize your green-screen mentality
and I know it is shared by many more,
I know it's quite impossible
but I am damned to find a way to revolve the other way,
every time I scrutinize I just say "screw it",
we're on a ride down a blind  conduit
and I just want to get off
Though extremely technical, which we know I love, this article about  urlLink neural network packet routers  shows a strain of logic that is admirable.
Thanks to support from  urlLink Val , a Word of the Day will become more and more common here.  Today I have stolen the word from  urlLink Dictionary.com :
ruminate \ROO-muh-nayt\, intransitive verb:

2. To think again and again; to muse; to meditate; to ponder; to reflect.
I definitely like the second definition better.

The new  urlLink i815E  chipset from  urlLink Chipzilla  is a definite improvement over the i810 and i820 chipsets, or so says a  urlLink review from Sharky Extreme .  The 820 is obviously plagued by the high cost of RDRAM.  After significant price cuts, 128meg of RDRAM still costs  $350 !  The 810 was plagued by the onboard video, which was not upgradeable.  The 815 uses SDRAM yet also has an AGP slot for video upgradability.  The 815 also has a great affinity for onboard hardware, such as a network adapter, modem, or sound card.  Brand new systems can be purchased for cheap when built with this chipset.

urlLink The Girls Room  tour was g.d. awesome!  The night started off excellently with the local act.  A powerful voice, skillful piano work, and undeniably emotional lyrics marked the performance by  urlLink Keri Noble .  No one was expecting anything from the local act, especially since we had seen her walking around nervously before the performance.  She played  Perfect , and two other songs of which I have forgotten the titles.   urlLink Tara MacLean  was the reason why she played three songs.  After two, Keri began to walk off stage while the crowd was in an uproar. Tara ran over and practically shoved her back on stage.  My group gave her a standing O when she was done.  Following this display of musical excellence was a mockery: Amy Correia.  Described as having a 'unique voice' and 'eclectic songs', that is just one way of saying that she sucks.  Expect www.AmyCorreiaSucks.com before too long.   Starfishin'  was one of the most annoying songs I have ever heard.   Angels Collide  had good lyrics, but that is the only good thing I will ever have to say about that girl.  Knowing that Tara was coming on next, my group sat on the floor directly in front of the stage.  Two of the people I was with had seen Tara 4 times before, and I have heard great things about her shows.  She was just as vivacious, cute, and talented as they had all said.  We all got to sing along with   urlLink If You Could   because the crowd did it for her last time she was in the Detroit area and she loved it.  After Tara was Shannon McNally: more crap.   Fast Forward to the signing session.  I was too shy to talk to either Keri or Tara.

Why do the Chinese use chopsticks?  They developed this custom because they didn't need anything resembling a knife and fork at the table. They cut up food into bite-sized pieces in the kitchen before serving it.  This stemmed from their belief that bringing meat to the table in any form resembling an animal was uncivilized and that it was inhospitable, anyway, to ask a guest to cut food while eating.
Religion fired up in my life when I was baptized  some  form of Christian.  This much I know, not because the holy water scalded and scarred my body, but because the parents say so.  The next religious event would be going to a Baptist church with my father around the age of 11.  Deciding that religion was a good thing, he took me an hour before the main service to attend their form of sunday school.  The other kids were practically wearing suits and their best dresses, while I sat timidly in a tucked in tshirt.  Not having any of the materials the other children did and not being able to answer any of the questions asked, I soon disappeared from their mind.  Seems that my father assumed that I would be able to find the main service after sunday school.   Wrong.  Being timid enough from the uber-Christian children, I did not even venture out of the basement.  All of the children my age left, and many parents brought down children too young for the main service.   For the next hour, I stayed with 6 year olds coloring Bible scenes while eating graham crackers with milk.  Needless to say, I never wanted to return to church again.  Dragged by my aunt and grandmother, I attended a few Catholic services over the years.  The idea of  "stand, sit, kneel, sit, pray, give money out of the infinite Catholic guilt"  process did not appeal to me.     By the age of 13, I realized there were other religions out there.  Not to say I was fully against Christianity, but my early experiences turned me from that faith in a hurry.  "God created Man in his own image" is reverse logic.   Man  created  God , especially in his own image.  Heaven and Hell are products of the human psyche being unable to comprehend unconciousness.  If the mind does not exist after death, how can we understand it?   Since that is impossible (sarcasm), Heaven and Hell were created as a true after life .  The afterlife is just like the mortal existence, yet a dichotomy is created.  If you were good, Heaven; Bad, Hell.  Is this not a very ingenious way to keep control over people during their entire life?  Then again, Karma is almost the same pattern.  Defining your next form through reincarntion based on Karma; it's the same sort of control.  Mankind has created religion as a way to answer that which cannot be answered.  Along the way, it has been tailored such that it can control the masses.    Studies on Buddhism and Hinduism were most appealing to me at a younger age.  Except for the aforementioned problems inherent with the karma and caste systems, the religions seem more logical.  There is Conservation of Matter and Conservation of Energy, so the idea of Conservation of Soul (life force, spirit) makes perfect sense to my logical mind.  Reincarnation, of some form, is the only conclusion to life that makes any sense.  Not even my mind can grasp the idea that we just  die .  Maybe I would enjoy life more knowing that.

The problems setting up the  urlLink OpenBSD  server continue.  In an attempt to make use of old hardware, I tried to use a Pentium 60 machine.  It was the very first real computer I ever used.  The Bios came out when the idea of "Plug and Play" did not exist. All of the network cards I have are PnP.  There is a way to configure them manually, but that would require installing them into my current machine (which can definitely handle PnP), booting from a DOS disk, then running a few utilities.  Instead, I will probably just use my old K6 233 machine.  In contrast, once I get the hardware setup, I will have almost no trouble  urlLink configuring OpenBSD 2.7 as a cable NAT system .

Wow, that was quite stupid of me.  I thought I was being smart by creating a /bsd partition in OpenBSD.  Well, I am not as smart as I think.  Unlike Linux, which puts the boot files (like the kernel) into a partition called /boot, BSDs put the kernel in the ROOT directory (/) as a FILE called bsd.  No wonder the installation process kept dying.
Hmm, my life just got easier.  Trying to setup that Windows 2000/Windows ME/Mac OS/OpenBSD environment was going to be a daunting task, mostly because of the need to share one cable modem.  OpenBSD has built in  urlLink Network Address Translation  which is extremely easy to setup.  Many machines, 1 IP, everyone gets net access.

A couple new weblogs added to the list this weekend:   urlLink Lake Effect  (brought to my attention when the creator, Dan, emailed me), and  urlLink Bitek Processor  (brought to my attention by  urlLink Lake Effect ).  ^_^
my.umich.edu (no link since the site isn't up) is a new portal being developed for the staff and students of The University of Michigan.  The  urlLink static gateway   that is currently in use has proved to be all but worthless, mostly because searching of lower pages in the hierarchy is chaotic.  A  urlLink preview  shows just how ugly the new site is going to be.  Also, one of the press releases talked about how headlines will be pulled directly from  urlLink The Michigan Daily website .  As the Systems Administrator, I can say that I just installed the new web server and it is not ready!  The  urlLink main online developer  has yet to configure the web server, mostly because we just installed the hardware late last week.  The site is being fully redesigned, and we are all quite excited.  Hopefully we can help with the headlines on my.umich.edu, in a couple months  .

More  urlLink Final Meal Requests :
Six pieces of french toast with syrup, jelly, butter, six barbecued spare ribs, six pieces of well burned bacon, four scrambled eggs, five well cooked sausage patties, french fries with catsup, three slices of cheese, two pieces of yellow cake with chocolate fudge icing, and four cartons of milk
How horrible!  In this list of  urlLink Final Meal Requests :
Shrimp and salad. Shrimp not available. Served cheeseburger, french fries and cola.   I would be just a little bit pissed when my dignified order was replaced with crap you could get at McDonalds.

I worked  17.5  hours yesterday.  Took a half an hour break for dinner between jobs, and that was about it for rest.  In  urlLink Ann Arbor , most of the client machines could not connect to anything but the file server.  Knowing that the file server uses Appletalk as the protocol and TCP/IP is used for everything else, we narrowed down the list of possible problems.  Checking out the error logs on our servers showed stuff like this over and over and over:
Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1
Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 141.211.148.76 to 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1
Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPREQUEST for 10.0.1.5 from 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1
Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPNAK on 10.0.1.5 to 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1
In basic terms, this is what was happening:  a system comes online and tries to DISCOVER the DHCP server, the server OFFERs a good IP from it's pool, the client REQUESTed a bad IP, and the server does Not AcKnowledge that request.  Then the cycle repeats.  This made no sense to all three of us working on the problem.   We tried restarting our DHCP server, we tried using a different server, etc etc.  FINALLY, Sat realized that someone had an  urlLink Apple AirPort  they wanted to hook up.   Searching the  urlLink Apple Tech Info Library , we found out that the AirPort acts as a DHCP server!  It was accepting all of the requests, and just giving out bad information!  Took that off the network, and everything returned to normal.  And it only took 8 hours to figure that out.
In the midst of a vast wilderness, far off, standing all alone, is a high mountain. You are sitting on open ground on top of the mountain, looking off into the distance in all directions. There are no boundaries. As you sit, you fill the world.  Relaxing and releasing body and mind, You abide in the Buddha-realm.

First there was the working artificial eye, and now there is the  urlLink moving artificial eye.
I used to joke about how my main non-free ISP was AOL (simply because a family member has paid for it, and I get an account), yet my main operating system has become some flavor of UNIX.  I thought I would never see this day, but there is now an  urlLink AOL client for Linux .  I cannot try it out, simply because I only have a winmodem that doesn't work in Linux, but we shall see when I get that cable modem...
They call it PMS because Mad Cow Disease was already taken.
Every morning I read all of the articles at  urlLink My AltaVista , simply because it is the automatic homepage when I use  urlLink AltaVista Free Access .  When I read that  urlLink Famke Janssen was learning to lap dance  for a new film, I didn't pay much attention.  Later in the day when I realized that  urlLink Janssen  played Dr. Jean Grey in the X Men movie, my thoughts fully changed.  She is one of under 5 women in the public eye (read: celebrities) that I find attractive.  The others include Natalie Portman and Christy Turlington.
The best part of  urlLink this article about cloning the Tazmanian tiger :
A far more emotional debate rages over the plan to reincarnate the tiger through cloning. Archer has crossed angry picket lines at his museum, and his work has been denounced by religious groups who accuse the scientists of playing God.  \93My response is that people played God when we exterminated the animal in the first place,\94 Archer said.
Heh.   urlLink Blue lobster becomes blue-plate special for tankmate .
Don't laugh.  It feels weird that I no longer have an  urlLink AOL  account.  Even though I have had much better ways to connect over the past two years (think LAN connected to a T1), the lack of the ability to hop on AOL is overwhelming.  No longer can I check the profiles of friends, no longer can I...    wait, I guess all I ever used AOL for was to check profiles.  I just need to 'borrow' an account from someone every once in awhile, and all will be good.
I remember discussing the futility of regrowing neurons in my Neurobiology class first semester of my sophomore year.  It was decided that even if new cells could be transplanted and they would grow, the neural net would be so complex that the cells would never fully integrate themselves.  The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania has made an attempt at this experiment.  The  urlLink results  show that the neurons helped stroke victims regain motor control.  A very promising step indeed.

urlLink Date Negotiations
Cast:
Bruce- Gerald
Mark- Gerald
[Bruce is behind his desk, rubbing a credit or business card down his cheek.]
Mark: [enters the office] Gerald.
Bruce: Gerald! How are you, ya old skunk?
Mark: Ah, how are you, ya old snake?
[They begin shaking hands.]
Bruce: Pretty good. [laughs] Good to see ya. Hey, how was your weekend?
Mark: Aw, not too bad. A little too short, though; how was yours?
Bruce: [laughs] Good, but a little short.
[Both laugh.]
Bruce: Business.
Mark: Yeah.
[They finally stop shaking and sit down--Bruce behind his desk and Mark in the chair in front of it.]
Both: So.
[Pause.]
Mark: Well, I would now be willing to take a look at the proposal your client is making to my Lori.
Bruce: On behalf of Dennis I'm, um, happy to show it to you.
[He hands Mark one large index card, which Mark looks at.]
Bruce: It's perfectly straightforward.
Mark: A little too damn straightforward, Gerald; don't you think?
Bruce: Uh...what do you mean?
Mark: I'm sorry. I can in no way say that this represents the interests of my client.
Bruce: It's a standard itinerary, Gerald--dinner, dancing, and [mumbles into his hand] intercourse.
Mark: [abruptly] I beg your pardon?
Bruce: [confident] Dinner, dancing, and intercourse.
Mark: You mean a quick *hump*, don't you Gerald?!
Bruce: I do not mean a quick hump, Gerald! Do not use that expression in this office! Children come in here!
Mark: "Dinner, dancing, and intercourse"--what do you think my client is, huh? A 90-dollar-an-evening hooker?
Bruce: This is dinner at the *Plaza*, Gerald.
Mark: Oh really?! So, she's a 120-dollar-an-evening hooker, is that it?
Bruce: Well, at least a hooker comes across. [pause] I can't believe I said that.
Mark: Gerald, do I sense that, uh, your client has certain feelings for my client?
Bruce: My client makes 62,000 dollars a year.
Mark: Ah. But, does your client have certain emotional interests towards my client.
Bruce: He's got a really great car and a moustache.
Mark: Gerald, does your client love my client?
Bruce: Yes! No! He's not sure. [pause] Back off Gerald!
Mark: I'll back off, but perhaps now you'd be willing to take a look at the proposal my client is making to your client.
Bruce: [big sigh]
[Mark opens up his briefcase and drops a folder containing a thick stack of papers onto the desk. Bruce opens the folder and flips through a few pages without really looking anything.]
Bruce: You forgot one thing, Gerald.
Mark: What's that?
Bruce: The actual date of the wedding and the color of the bridesmaids' gowns!
Mark: Come off it Gerald. It's a standard 17-week dating commitment. All my client wants to do is to get to know your client.
Bruce: Hey, all my client wants to do is get to know your client.
Mark: In a completely different way!
Bruce: I don't know, I think she's gotten to know quite a few clients. [Opens up desk drawer, ready to take out folders.] Let's just look at her roster of ex-boyfriends.
Mark: Gerald, that's inadmissible and you know it!
Bruce: [realizes his error and gently closes the drawer.] The Doobie Brothers??
[pause]
Mark: All right, perhaps we were a little hasty with the 17-week dating commitment. Perhaps we can accommodate the obvious interests of your client a bit more. How about this: a six date schedule with possible sexual intercourse on date six.
Bruce: Gerald, I'm no longer interested in this "possible sexual intercourse" you keep selling me on. Last time, it turned out to be a cheap handjob at the drive in.
Mark: Your client ejaculated, Gerald!
Bruce: Sadly. Very sadly. Let's just let sleeping dogs lie, shall we? [pause] Three date schedule, guaranteed sexual intercourse on dates two and three.
Mark: Uh uh. Five date schedule, guaranteed sexual intercourse on date five. Now that's a one-way ticket to Loveland, Gerald. That's a heap of good lovin'. That's a Love-o-rama. That's a Love Fest. That's a Love Woodstock, for God's sake. Come back to me.
[Long pause. Bruce has a goofy smile on his face, in thought.]
Bruce: Gerald. [calling him in closer] Gerry. [closer] Ger. . .Guh. Why don't we forget the guaranteed sexual intercourse clause.
Mark: Okay.
Bruce: Why don't we let nature take it's course.
Mark: Fine!
Bruce: You know the good old fashioned way?
Mark: [eagerly] Yeah, okay.
Bruce: A one date schedule with a guarantee that your client will consume 27-ounces of gin on that evening.
Mark: Come off it Gerald! That's panty peeler and you know it.
Bruce: Call it what you will, it's a tool of the trade.
Mark: Sorry Gerald. C'mon, she only weighs 105 pounds, for God's sake.
Bruce: I believe she weighs 111 pounds, Gerald.
Mark: In shoes! [pause] All right. I can't see letting her drink more than 8-ounces of gin.
Bruce: Jeez, I think she can drink, uh, 14-ounces of gin.
Mark: Maybe 10, maybe 10.
Bruce: I think she could scarf down 12-ounces of gin.
Mark: 11-ounces of gin.
Bruce: 12-ounces of gin on an empty stomach.
Mark: 11 on an empty stomach.
Bruce: [taps his fingers on the desk, calculating in his head.] 111. . .Done!
Mark: Okay.
[Both getting up]
Mark: I'll have my secretary pick up the contracts Monday.
[They lean over and kiss each other on the cheek. Mark turns to leave and then they do a subtle double take.]
urlLink Teddy Bear's Picnic
Cast-
Scott- son
Bruce- father
Dave- mother
[Bruce is singing his son to sleep.]
Bruce: [singing] Picnic time for teddy bears / Those little teddy bears are having a wonderful time tonight.
[Bruce tries to leave because Scott appears to be asleep. As soon as Bruce tries this, Scott wakes up and looks to Bruce as if he's not at all tired.]
Bruce: [singing] See them gaily play about / They love to sing and shout.
[Bruce tries to leave again, same thing happens.]
Bruce: [singing] They haven't got any cares [Gets up to leave but this time continues to sing] But it's six o' clock / Their mummies and daddies will take them home to bed / Because they're tired little teddy bears. [talking] Good night. [Flips light off.]
Scott: Dad?
Bruce: [light back on, still at doorway] Uh, yes?
Scott: Were all the bears there?
Bruce: Yes. All the bears there ever there was were there. Goodnight.
Scott: Dad? How--how come the picnic ended at six o' clock? If it was so good? I mean, it's--it's not even dark at six.
Bruce: Uh, all the bears were tired from, um..., frolicking.
Scott: Oh.
Bruce: Frolicking's very tiring, son. Goodnight
Scott: Okay, what they--what they eat?
Bruce: Oh. Well. The teddy bears ate buttons and...felt.
Scott: Ewww!
Bruce: Oh, no no! That's teddy bear food.
Scott: Oh.
Bruce: It's like hot dogs. Mmm.
Scott: Okay, yeah. Were you even there? What?
Bruce: [Bruce sees he is not about to leave, so he goes back to Scott at the bed.] No, I wasn't actually there.
Scott: Well, then--then how do you know?
Bruce: A guy at work told me.
Scott: Who?
Bruce: Hank.
Scott: Hank who?
Bruce: You don't know him.
Scott: Maybe I should call this Hank.
Bruce: No no. I don't think that would be a good idea, son.
Scott: Why?
Bruce: Because he doesn't have a phone.
Scott: What?! What kind of a freak doesn't have a phone?
Bruce: A freak that works in the mailroom.
Scott: Ohh.
Bruce: Now go to sleep.
Scott: Dad, I can't sleep trying to piece together this sloppy narrative.
Bruce: [sighs] Why don't you try, uh, counting sheep?
Scott: [cries/whines] Ahh!!
Bruce: What? What, guy?
Scott: How can you make me think of all those slaughtered sheep bloated in the sun? [cries]
Bruce: They're not slaughtered sheep, son. They're live ones bounding over your head.
Scott: What? I thought they were dead! You didn't tell me they were alive. Dad, I was up all night tagging their toes. [cries]
[Dave enters]
Dave: What is going on around here?
Scott: [still crying] Maa! Uh uh!
[Dave goes over to Scott, who in turn clings onto Dave's arm.]
Dave: Oh, oh. There, there. What is it?
Scott: Yeah, yeah. Dad told me this "Teddy Bears' Picnic" story and it sounds like utter bullshit to me.
Dave: There, there. Just remember that your father loves you and I love you even more. . .
Scott: Okay.
Dave: . . . and if you ever use that kind of language in this house again, I'm gonna wash your mouth out with soup.
Scott: Oh.
Bruce: Uh, I think that's soap, dear.
Dave: Don't ever contradict me in front of the boy. There, there, little hero, you get some sleep. Okay.
Scott: Okay, `night mom.
Dave: `Night.
Bruce: `Night, Tiger.
[Bruce approaches Scott to give him a kiss, but Scott puts his fists up in self-defense. Bruce kisses the fists. Bruce and Dave leave, they turn out the light, and Scott is alone.]
Scott: Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit. Mmm, soup.
[Cut to parents' bedroom.]
Bruce: Goodnight.
Dave: So, this Teddy Bears' Picnic story isn't true?
Bruce: Um, no. Not exactly.
Dave: Well, if you weren't helping out at the picnic, where were you last weekend? Hmm?
Bruce: You think I'm having an affair, don't you?!
Dave: [shocked] An affair?!! Oh my God!
Bruce: Um, you didn't think that?
Dave: [shakes his head no.]
Bruce: Oh. Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you. I was out with a few of the guys from work. . .and a few goblins. . .and, uh, it started raining gumdrops. . .so uh. . .we happened into this wizard's tavern, and uh. . .I'm gonna be honest, we had a little too much dew to drink. So, uh. . .I thought I shouldn't drive.
Dave: Well, you did the right thing by not driving, but you should have called.
Bruce: Well, you know, it's the darndest thing, honey, um, the wizard's leaf wouldn't dial out.
Dave: Well, fine. But next time you should just try harder to get a hold of me.
Bruce: You're right, sweetie.
Dave: Alright.
Bruce: Goodnight. [turns out the nightstand's light.]
Dave: Who's Doris?
Bruce: [Turns light back on. Frantically:] Doris. Doris, Doris, uh, Doris.
Dave: Doris. A woman named Doris came to the house the other day and said she'd been meeting you for some time in sleazy motel rooms and that she was carrying your child and wanted to know what you were going to do about it, and I was just wonder who she was.
Bruce: Uh, I could see why you'd be curious.
Dave: Yes, well she did pique my interest, yes.
Bruce: Honey? She's a goat. She's a magical goat. And, she delights on playing tricks on us mere mortals.
Dave: I am so. . .relieved!
[Bruce also relieved. Both laugh.]
Dave: I feel like such an idiot.
Bruce: Don't feel like an idiot. No no, it's natural.
Dave: Oh, can you forgive me?
Bruce: I do, I do.
Dave: Oh, I should be jealous. [cuddles into covers]
Bruce: [turns out light] Yes you should.

Amazing.  Just got back to  urlLink The University of Michigan  for the new semester, and  urlLink The Pop vs. Soda Page  couldn't be more prevalent.  Most people say pop here, as is correctly indicated on the map, but the out-of-staters say soda.  Idiots.

Linking up an  urlLink iMac  to an  urlLink  OpenBSD  box to a  urlLink Windows 2000  box to a  urlLink Windows Millenium Edition  box is a lot harder than I thought.  I have failed at getting either  urlLink Samba  or  urlLink netatalk  to work on the unix box.  Both will compile, but both have serious problems when launched.  There was even difficulty sharing between the Windows ME and Windows 2000 boxes!  I forgot that I disabled Guest access on the W2K machine, and that prevented the WinME machine from connecting.  Grr
World War II is  urlLink not officially over ?
Clean is good, a mantra I have recently accepted.  This is mostly because through a laborious process which failed,  I lost my main partition .  The last incarnation of this system had partitions setup for Windows 98, Windows 2000, linux, a linux swap file and a FAT32 data partition (MP3s, thanks).  No matter how hard I tried, I could only boot into linux using a boot disk.  The Windows 2000 bootloader was not smart enough to load it.  Originally, I had  urlLink Red Hat 6.2 installed .  Feeling adventurous, I decided to install  urlLink CAEN linux  instead.  Who wouldn't want to run a distribution of linux created at their  urlLink own university ?!  For some odd reason, CAEN tried to use my network card at IRQ 0, which just does not work.  Also, since it is based on Red Hat 6.1, it did not properly recognize my GeForce video card.  Screw that, time to go back to Red Hat 6.2.   Oops, now that is trying to set my NIC to IRQ 0!   Screw that, lets go with  urlLink linux Mandrake .  The NIC was properly configured for IRQ 5, but it still wouldn't see my gateway.  I figured I could work on that later.  I got x windows working just fine, but by this point I figured I should get some work done.  Since all of my course hyperlinks were stored in Windows 2000, a quick reboot should get me going.   Reboot, walk away, come back to linux.  WTF?  Reboot, wait for my Windows 2000 bootloader menu to show.  Linux.  WTF?!   Reboot, look for any promising signs, boot into linux.  Try to mount my windows partition, get weird errors about bad disklabels and superblocks.  At this point, I knew what the outcome was.  My C drive got fried by Linux Mandrake because it was not smart enough to ask me where I wanted the boot information.  All of my documents from the past year, all my conversations, anything:  GONE .  Oh well, nothing I can do about it now....
I know, I know...  this sporatic posting has  got  to stop.  I apologize.  Life has been very hectic lately, and I am just now getting used to the new semester.  Let's start from the most recent and work our way back...   Today was my first discussion section for CS 280 (C++ programming).  We went over the mysteries that are FTP, telnet, pico, and the g++ compiler.  Aside to that obvious sarcasm, the GSI (graduate student instructor (read: TA)) is quite foreign, and impossible to understand.  No longer will my prescence be necessary at that class.  During 280 lecture yesterday, I sat beside an overly stressed sorority girl.  The stereotype was in full effect, as she complained about how she had no time for programming since it was rush week and she had to party.  She also complained about the complexity of UNIX.  All she has to do was type three well-documented commands.  We are even allowed to use Visual C++ for most of the work!   Dumb blonde.   Two nights ago was scary.  The main server at The Michigan Daily went down.  All of the stories, production templates, everything.  Couldn't do anything to the server remotely, so I dragged my ass to StudPub.  Logged in at the console, and it turns out that all 4 of the data hard drives had crashed, destroyed their disklabels, and could not be accessed with AppleTalk.  After an hour of scratching my head as to what would cause the 4 data drives to crash all at once, yet keep the operating system drive intact, we decided to blame the weather.  "Lightning", we told all of the frustrated Daily staff.  Oddly enough, even without disklabels, the drives randomly came back up for an hour.  Down for 2 more hours, and now they have been up for 48.  Stability, not my concern.  Other than that, life has been boring....    Everyone needs to  urlLink tell me what makes their life interesting .
Finally!  The  urlLink FCC wants open source IM protocol .  No longer would AIM use proprietary code or servers, and all IM types could talk to each other.

How random!   urlLink Modern Humorist  is a fairly funny site which I have only just discovered.  Just like  urlLink The Onion  did awhile back, they have  urlLink mentioned my hometown of Livonia, Michigan .  It's buried near the bottom, so keep reading.  That place is a strip mall of 100,000 people, 98% of which are white.  The city is not worthy of mention.
Here it is, 9:15 AM or so.  If I was going to see Phish this weekend, I would have left by now.  You can just hear my spirits deflate.
Whoa, I just realized that I am going to Chicago for the weekend.  This has been planned since my birthday (August 4th -- don't forget next year!) when I got the tickets to  urlLink Phish , but I almost completely forgot.  It will be a fun fun weekend, believe me.

I am not upset that I weigh 190lbs.  I am upset that this is the first time in my adult life that my weight is greater than my IQ  and  my bench press.
Perhaps the film I'm looking most forward to next year is DUDE, WHERE's MY CAR who's plot outline simply states, "Two potheads wake up from a night of partying and can't remember where they parked their car. With Fabio as a guest star, and characters like "Nordic Dude #2" in the credits, it's cleary next year's blockbuster.  Stolen, again, from  urlLink X-E .
Christopher Reeve broke his leg on August 17th during physical therapy. The exact cause of the injury is unknown, but sources close to Reeve suggest it may have something to do with trying to get a crippled guy to walk.  Stolen from  urlLink X-E .
The Smashing Pumpkins are on their way out, but in a great way.  Sick of their record label, they decided to allow the  urlLink entire album to be available on MP3 .  That is not a link to a news story, that is a link to the MP3s themselves!
If any of you want to run your own web server, definitely check out  urlLink DevShed - Server Side  for a healthy dose of knowledge.  Learn about PHP, Perl, Apache, etc.  I love this stuff!
What the hell?  My keyboard just died.  I thought maybe it was the AT --> PS/2 converter I was using, but a replacement did not improve the situation.  Then I thought maybe it was the port on my motherboard.  I found a PS/2 -- > USB converter and tried that.  I 'borrowed' a roommate's keyboard, and that worked just fine.  Feeling quite pissed off (do you have any idea how hard it is to use a computer without a keyboard?), I took the old keyboard and shook it around a bit.  The power of fear made it work again.  Now I can get back to my regular life.
Yes,  urlLink Redhat Linux 7.0  is out, but when will we be able to download it?  The  urlLink FTP site  has been so bogged down that not even the mirror sites can download the necessary files.  Even the  urlLink support site  that only paying customers can access is busy!  I have successfully connected to one mirror site that had RH 7.0, but the did not have the CD image files (ISOs) that I wanted.  99% of older Linux distributions fail in some way on my hardware, so I figured there would be hope with the most brand new version.  When will I get to find out?!

Heh, I was just kidding, folks.   I did end up going to see Phish!
The lot crowd before the show was a bit melancholy, which was most definitely caused by the combination of planes roaring directly overhead every two minutes and the slight amount of rain.  Once everyone got inside, the mood was dramatically lifted, mostly because we were no longer cold and wet.  Here is the setlist:
Set I (0:53): Come On Baby Lets Go Downtown > Moma Dance, Frankenstein, Halley's Comet > Fee, Stash
Set II (1:12): Birds of a Feather, Tweezer> NICU > Scent of a Mule, Fast Enough for You, Piper > Character Zer0
Encore (0:09): Sleeping Monkey > Tweezer Reprise
Short first set, eh?  The reason: GLOWSTICKS.  People throwing hundreds of glow sticks all over the arena is a cool effect in the dark smoke-saturated environment.  People throwing glow sticks at  the stage , at   the band   -- not good.  We probably missed out on two songs because of it.  Most people knew something was wrong at intermission.  The arena crowd created a cacophony after the second set which was probably the ONLY reason why Phish did an encore.  The crowd really did not deserve it.  Thus, we got two songs, and the band bowed and ran off stage.  Dodging glowsticks.  Again.  Bastard phans.
This makes me oddly depressed.  The mere idea that the  urlLink X-33 will not fly  is troubling.  Mostly, because of the Mars Lander fiasco, NASA is not seen in the brightest of lights anymore.  The delays in developing the X-33 are mostly safety based (which makes sense if anyone remembers a  urlLink slight problem  in 1986 with the Challenger...), but these delays are not giving NASA credibility.  They need one project to work, and to work  well .  The International Space Station is still in development, and can't save them yet...
The Simpsons has been a favorite TV show for most geeks for over 10 years.  In the last few seasons, the quality has dropped quickly as the original writers have left.  This MSNBC  urlLink article  got it just right.  The Simpsons should be taken off the air.

Looking for a  new computer?  Looking for a very small new computer?  The  urlLink Espresso PC  is about the size of a large graphing calculator.  I would be afraid of losing that thing.  The cost is prohibitive since it uses mostly notebook parts.  Less expensive (but much larger) is the  urlLink BookPC .  This uses normal PC parts in a footprint about the size of a phonebook.  Neither of these systems are very upgradeable (Cannot upgrade anything on the Espresso, cannot put any new cards into the Book), but neither is the very popular  urlLink iMac !  Got to install one of the new DV models yesterday, and it could not be much easier.
Michigan State (3-3) at (16) Michigan (5-2)
Player to Watch: Ryan Van Dyke, QB, Michigan State. Starter has struggled since returning from injury and even got replaced last week by Jeff Smoker.
Breakdown:
Both sides are issuing the standard spin about this being a tough rivalry game, but reality says it's a mismatch. Despite their 3-0 start, the Spartans clearly are in a rebuilding year following a 10-2 campaign in 1999. The only consistency is RB T.J. Duckett, the nation's No. 5 rusher (148.3 yards). Michigan exploded in a 58-0 win last week and will likely go right at the Spartans' wobbly defensive front with powerful RB Anthony Thomas.
Oh man, I almost missed this tidbit of MSU vs UM greatness:   Snews published a  urlLink comic displaying the fear they have for our team ...
Lets try this a third time!   urlLink The Michigan Daily  and  urlLink The State News  are sharing a bit too much today.  They shared articles rippping into each other:  The Daily published this  urlLink rebuttal  to the  urlLink Erin McQuinn article from October 10th .  Snews published  urlLink this article putting down Spartan tradition .  In contrast, Snews also  urlLink created a beautiful image of Ann Arbor and the culture , comparing it to a small European city.  An odd assortment for the last day of publishing before the Big Game....

The big decision looms:  Do I stick with crappy IDE hardware, or do I start to upgrade to SCSI?  The new  urlLink PleXWriter PX-W1210S  cd burner is 12x/10x/32x and SCSI.  The IDE version of the same has been a top drive for some time.  With SCSI, upgrading is easy.  With IDE, the price is actually reasonable.  Plextor IDE: $250.   Plextor SCSI:  $380 .   That just made up my mind.

urlLink Brain Size In Premature Infants Significantly Smaller Than Full-Term Babies ...   isn't that a well-known fact?  The braincase of humans is so large at full development that females would have to be structured very differently to give birth.  Instead, the brain and braincase increase in size  after birth .  Of course the brain is going to be one of the last things to fully develop, and thus premature babies will have smaller brains.

The world, and especially the US, is going to encounter an energy shortage in the next 30 years.  The oil supply is steady now, but it is estimated that with our current rate of extraction, that supply will be nil in 25 years.  Coal reserves can stretch out for 5 years beyond that, and then our fossil fuels are gone.  As of 1998, 89% of the energy of the world was produced from fossil fuels.  Alternative energy sources are less efficient, such as nuclear energy.  Future energy sources need to be developed.   urlLink Fusion  would be an excellent development, since power output is almost 10 times the power input.  The US has completely stepped out of the research and development of fusion power, hoping that Russia/Japan/Canada will develop the technology and license it to the world.
With a headline like  urlLink Scientists Learn To Program Human Dreams , you would think this was a great accomplishment.  Instead, they had people play Tetris for like 3 days straight, and 60% of the people ended up having a dream about Tetris.  Try again, science-folks.

Well, once again, I got to miss a  urlLink Bad Religion  show.  I have been a fan for 7 years now, and I have missed at least 8 possible shows.  The first few were because of that gigantic thumb I lived under; I called it "Parental Guidance".  During that middle period, I missed the shows because the album they were touring for frankly sucked.  Fast forward to 2000, the May release of   urlLink The New America   and I started to get excited with the band again.   Preliminary reports of this tour got me even more excited since they were playing mostly older songs (read:  good songs)!   They come to SE Michigan on tour for this new album, and  I am too busy to go to the show .    At least  urlLink The Daily  published a  urlLink nice article  about them yesterday.

Pro-lifers in Britain are attempting to stop the separation of Siamese twins joined at the lower abdomen.  The procedure would save the life of one, while the other could not be saved.  The pro-lifers are vying to have the House of Lords rule on this matter since it is along the lines of abortion.  Their idea is that the House of Lords would either postpone or oppose the seperation.
Here is the kicker:  if the two are not seperated, they will both die within months.
Here is the broad generalization: Pro-lifers are complete idiots.

The idea that  urlLink Apple is moving toward x86 hardware  is old.  Most people do not realize that even if they did move toward x86, you would not be able to just grab a Mac OS X CD, format your Windows box, and install freely.  Parts of the x86 hardware are going to be proprietary, at least at first.  Specific hardware will be supported to get the x86 platform started, then full support may roll in if the idea takes off.
Sega is about to stop producing hardware of all types, but as a final hurrah they may produce a  urlLink PCI card for PCs to play Dreamcast games .  I see a slight problem with this.  The Dreamcast uses a proprietary GD-ROM, and not the usual CD-ROM.  You can emulate all you want, but hardware is hardware.
I never played the original Mechwarrior,  I loved the  urlLink sequel  and  urlLink expansion packs , then the  urlLink third installment  was marred by horrendous control.  Mechwarrior 4, though put out by M$, has some great  urlLink previews .  These  urlLink previews  show off the mechs of the series.  Way back in the day when I used to *cough*roleplay*cough*, we would mostly make our mechs/characters and that would be it.  Spend about 3 hours making the perfect character, flushing out all of the details, and never actually use them.  If I find my old folder of characters, I will scan some in just so you can all know how low I have been.

An hour of downtime equals an upgraded server.  I just upgraded this web server (which is also my ftp server, DHCP server, MP3 server, and would be my DNS server if it wasn't so slow) to  urlLink OpenBSD 2.8 .  There was a  urlLink huge list of changes from 2.7  and even though none of them seemed critical, upgrades are always nice.
urlLink The Bench.org : community cartooning : a very interesting idea.  An Open Source comic strip, practically.  People are allowed to use the characters from  urlLink Penny Arcade  and make up their own strips.  There are almost 4000 strips now, in various states of quality in humor and artistry.  The gems are few and far between, but they also hit a wide variety of subjects such as  urlLink Dragonball Z .

Well, I think it is time to change my screen name (nick, handle, whatever you want to call it).  When I first got online, I used Felix.  That was mostly on the non-elite BBSs I frequented.  By high school, I started to use Takashi000.  If you have ever seen the movie  urlLink Akira , then you might remember Takashi as a character.   If you really remember the movie,  you might realize that Takashi26 would have been a better handle.  Nah, I like zeros.
I believe it was in my first year of college that I decided a new name was needed.  No longer a big fan of Akira, Takashi000 was retired.  The first couple years of college were some of my least stable.  During this time period, I was quite morbid, and was completely convinced that I would be dead at a young age.  There was little hope.  The only concept of hope that I had was mythical, the idea of being a  urlLink phoenix .  That is the reason behind  urlLink Phoenix26x , my current handle.
That would be the third handle I have grown out of, so maybe I should pick something a bit more permanent.  Here are the possibilities:
MikeBibik: this one shouldn't be hard to figure out.
BibikDotOrg:  why not advertise for the site at the same time?
ChaosTerminal:  ...or just advertise the weblog.
OpenBSoD:  OpenBSD is my favorite server OS, and BSoD is the Windows "Blue Screen of Death".   It's a geek pun, which is fitting for who I have become.

Not sure who is the original source of this:
so i'm waiting for the bus at cc little to go to north campus, and this girl walks up and stands next to me.  she's hot, by the way, and she's wearing a tri-delt sweatshirt.  after i was done thinking about how hot she was, i realize that she's an idiot because i'm wearing my winter fucking coat and am still cold and she's standing outside waiting for a bus in nothing more than a sweatshirt.  well, i've probably never been more right about anything in my life.
so right when the bus is coming up she sees one of her friends - had to be in a sorority if not tridelt due to the black fuck me pants, black down north face jacket, black wool hat and black framed glasses.  she also had black sandals on - yes, it was still cold outside.
as i get on the bus, they sit down in front of me, which was nice, because remember, they're both hot.  i'm not really paying attention to anything in particular, mostly because i'm contemplating how much it sucks that i'm going to north campus to sit in a class that i don't really need to be going to anyway, and so it catches me off guard a bit when i realize what the two girls in front of me are talking about.  hard boiled eggs.  it was just weird, that's all.
so anyway, i'm listening to the girl in black bitch about how her roommate will hard boil all of the eggs in the fridge to use on salads at once, and then keep them in the egg carton so that when she wants to use an egg (god only know for what purpose - it certainly wasn't to eat, unless she was planning on inducing vomiting afterwards) she cracks it open only to find that it's hard boiled and not a raw egg. well this is where it starts to get entertaining for all of the engineers on the bus.  now, it was just about 1 o'clock when i was on the bus, so there were a lot of non-engineering students just headed back to bursley after class, and thus only about half the bus was keeping an eye on the hot chicks - you see, engineers don't come across girls much, and when we encounter hot chicks we tend to just kind of stare at them.  well, anyway, remember the girl in black was talking about all of the hard boiled eggs.
so, the girl in the sweatshirt says, rather loudly, "well, why don't you just unboil them?"
now, remember we on the bus that are paying attention are all engineers. i had already figured out that this girl was an idiot (sweatshirt in the cold), but the rest of the engineers must have been too engrossed staring at her to think much of that, so when she says the line about unboiling the eggs, one engineer just about chokes on his jimmy john's while the others stares turn from awe to amazement and shock at her stupidity - it really was funny.
so the girl in black actually notices everyone staring at them at this point, and gets a little bit freaked out.  she says something like, "what the fuck are you talking about, you can't unboil an egg", to which dumb sweatshirt girl says, sure you can, my boyfriend told me all about it.
and i'll spare you the story, but it basically involved a practical joke that her boyfriend had played on her which resulted in her cracking a raw egg on her forehead.  by now, most of the people on the bus, even the non-engineers, are trying to contain their laughter.  i really can't, and i'm pretty much laughing out loud, but only the girl in black notices.
and she gets pissed - either at the sweatshirt girl, or at everyone laughing at her, i don't know - and starts YELLING, "YOU CANT UNBOIL AN EGG".  each time she yells it, sweatshirt girl starts getting bitchier and bitchier, yelling "YES YOU CAN".  finally, the dude in front of them turns around, looks sweatshirt girl in the eye and says "you're crazy, you can't unboil an egg". this shut her up at least, and the north face girl looks really happy at being validated - i think that during the whole argument she wasn't really sure herself that you couldn't unboil an egg.
so the sweatshirt girl just sits there for a minute, and then i can hear her mumbling under her breath something about "chemicals" and "her boyfriend" and she finally tells the northface girl that "i'm sure you can somehow."
northface girl of course just yells "NO YOU CANT".
by now, most of the engineers have slapped their foreheads and left their hands there, making a pretty funny scene - a whole bunch of dorky guys holding their hands to their heads while shaking them.
the girls talked about it for a while, and finally sweatshirt girl agreed that maybe you couldn't unboil an egg.  by now, the rest of the bus was talking about it, and from the front, we could all hear a flaming homosexual music major ask, in the loudest, gayest voice possible, "Well, why *couldn't* you unboil an egg", which caused me and just about everyone else to go into convulsions of laughter all over again.
by now, we had just about reached the stop, but stupid sweatshirt girl wasn't done yet.  she had started talking about how it was tuesday, and tomorrow was wednesday, and how we should change the calendar so that wednesday was the first day in the week and tuesday was the last, so that we would have the weekend in the middle of the week.
one of the engineers to our right had had enough i guess, and interrupted the two girls to inform them that if you put the weekend in the middle of the week, it would no longer be a weekend, it would be a weekmiddle.
neither girl understood it, and while he tried to explain for a bit, we all ended up getting off the bus before he had a chance to finish.
urlLink Version 6.0, LIVE .  Coming next, a PHP/SQL driven site.
Server upgrade complete!   The downtime wasn't so much for the extra 128 megs of RAM I installed, but more so that I can undo the overclocking...   Unix is much better at making use of a CPU than any form of Windows.  That Celeron 366 overclocked to 550MHz without problem on my old Windows 2000 machine.  During certain activities (mostly compiling), the computer (the same CPU now in my OpenBSD machine) would completely freeze.  This is not normal for Unix, so it must be the overclocking.  Running comfortably at 366MHz, the machine should be 100% stable.
To all 5 of you that read this site:  The site will be going down again for an upgrade (hardware this time) at 8:00 PM EST.  Expected downtime will be less than one hour.  Thank you.

The MP3 of the week has been updated.   urlLink Radiohead  released Kid A awhile ago, and it is a radical departure from the glory that is OK Computer.  Most of the songs grow on you, and I absolutely adore Optimistic.  The background vocals are melodic (and blend in perfectly with the simplistic guitar riffs), the main vocals are crisp, and there are enough hooks for everyone to love this song.  Not sure if this is radio-single-style quality, but it's quality nonetheless.  The lyrics have a perfect sense of sardonicism (yes, that is a word, go look it up, MOFO):
You can try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one dropped a payload

*SPANKED*   That is all there is to it.  Java final: spank.  Anatomy lab practical final: spank.  Neither of those exams went well, to say the least.   To make matters worse, the exams were set back to back:  Java final from 6-8pm, Anatomy lab final from 8-9pm.  The fact that the exams were 2 miles apart also caused a problem.  Add in the "snow" factor, the "buses running late" factor, and the "my ride never showed up" factor, and you have a cold, late Mikey.  I got to the lab practical just in time to start, without instruction.  Luckily the lab format was "here is a hacked up animal-like thing; what is this inordinately small object inside the carcass?"  or "don't tell us what *that* object is, but tell us what it is related to in this other hacked up carcass".  Hey, all that matters is that I am done.

Having taken both a chordate anatomy class and an evolution class, this  urlLink article about an aquatic origin for humans  is quite intriguing.  Many of the adaptations shown by humans could be explained by certain aspects of an aquatic life.   The examples they give are not in depth enough to be convincing though.  This is just an article from a popular scientific magazine, and thus hardcore facts are avoided.  Also, it seems that the researchers are jumping to conclusions.  Yes, brain size and posture could be explained by this theory.  The main problem is that there are no other concrete facts that support this idea, such as a fossil record that shows evolution of these traits.

Mwahahaha....    The new MD.com is coming along quite nicely.  BTW, I am back in Ann Arbor.  Christmas was a good change of pace, but now I have to get back to work.

4 bedrooms (2 singles, 2 doubles)
2 bathrooms
2 floors
Dishwasher
Air Conditioning
Only one parking space.
The apartment complex name is 'Canterbury Lodge' and the apartment name is 'Penthouse C'...  you can't get much better than that.
HOLY SHIT!   Pardon my language.   You know how the network connection between my main production machine and my server was so slow?   Well, I messed around with some settings and changed a hard-coded 100TX setting to auto-detect.  Check this:
STATUS:>      Send successful
STATUS:>      Time: 0:01:04, Efficiency: 5269.62 KBytes/s
I transfered a 340 meg file in just about a minute.   Excellent!
Well, TMD.com is taking a lot longer than expected.  We have gone through code issues, server issues, politcal issues, etc etc.   The estimated time of completion is this Friday, but I would take that with a grain of salt.
My site is finally back online, and it should stay online.    urlLink Granitecanyon  screwed up again, so I searched for another solution.    urlLink Register.com , the company I registered with, offers free DNS service.   So far it seems to be working just great!   Downtime is a bitch.
I am beginning to think there is something wrong with my server:   fireball:named {103} ls -lart Segmentation fault
What a day!  Here is what was accomplished:  Finally declared biology as one of my majors, signed my lease for next year, dropped down a check for $1300, fixed two major problems at work (Netboot vs DHCP & Oracle crashing), fixed a computer for a beer and had 6 hours of class.  Let's see what my night holds....
Whoa, gotta love  urlLink geek art !
My high school graduating class had about 450 students.  Within my high school was a smaller group, MSC (Math/Science/Computers).  This elite group of geeks had some serious issues (that could be a whole other site), but most of us had one thing in common.  Check out this  urlLink image .  This is the graduating class of MSC for 1998.  All of the people circled ended up going to  urlLink UMich  (or  urlLink U of M-D ).
urlLink The Blind Pig  in Ann Arbor used to be a small, poorly lit, smokey bar with horrendous accoustics.  Now it is a small, poorly lit, smokey bar with horrendous accoustics and it's filled with stupid rich girls on cell phones!  Argh.
Excellent...    urlLink Akira is being rereleased .
Recently, my musical tastes have changed.  Not that I have stopped listening to chick music ( urlLink Tori ,  urlLink LTC ,  urlLink The Sundays ) or punk ( urlLink Bad Religion ,  urlLink Millencolin ,  urlLink Pulley ,  urlLink Guttermouth ).  Lately, I have been listening to  urlLink Sloan  and  urlLink Radiohead , and a lot of rap mixed in between.  Laura and I spent a good hour downloading and listening to a bunch of old school rap songs.  Check them out  urlLink here !
The only problem with the Microsoft sites being down is that I can't play  urlLink Bejeweled !
It's  urlLink up !   More info later.

Ok, this one is coming with a BIG disclaimer:  The comic I am about to link to is sexually graphic, sickly so.  It's still really funny. :-)  urlLink The THIN H LINE Online Comic
CNN thinks these  urlLink little robots  are gonna change the world.   Nope, not gonna happen.
Also, if you are a UMich student, go check out the  urlLink michigandaily.com Forum .  You get to talk about why the Daily is great (or more likely why it sucks), talk about random topics, and most importantly about Erin McQuinn.
If you are a UMich student, go check out  urlLink my.umich.edu , then bitch them out for not including a News service.   It's in the works, and  urlLink michigandaily.com  was redone with the idea of serving news to my.umich specifically.  I have been informed that the service will be up "some time soon", but that could be months from now.
Eheheh...   guess what I got.  Here is a hint:   urlLink Valhalla  (my baby, the web server),  urlLink Moose ,  urlLink Zeus , and the bastard  urlLink switches .  Let's see, the quality of those  pictures  are pretty low, and I just took them tonight.  You can guess what I got by now, eh?
ARGH!    urlLink NASA Shuts Down X-33, X-34 Programs .    I could care less about the International Space Station (Alpha) and now NASA scraps the reusable rocket designs.  I was DROOLING over these designs (three different times on this weblog alone:   urlLink Feb2000 ,  urlLink Mar2000 , and  urlLink Oct2000 ).  Time to start building my own...
urlLink Snoop Dogg does porn .  Surprised?
The pictures within this article couldn't be better:  urlLink Racer\92s death exposes cultural divide .  The guys in the first picture should be the spokesmen for NASCAR.
Definitely a new favorite:  urlLink Plastic.com .  It is run off the same software as  urlLink Slashdot  (called  urlLink Slash , created by the Slashdot kids), but looks much better.  The design is truly meaningless since the content is what keeps me coming back day to day.  Instead of the pure tech content of Slashdot, it seems more like a intelligent and logical version of  Salon .  The topics are just broad enough.  My only hope is that more people find this great site and use the comment system.
Does anyone else find it funny that when you search for  urlLink windows news site on Google , it comes up with  urlLink Slashdot ?
This is a slick, clean design.  I am pretty sick of swirls and swoops in logos though...  urlLink Progeny Linux Systems .
Sys Admin Tip #1: Do not drop tea onto your networking hardware.
Which is funnier?  The fact that someone is offering to  urlLink call you and sound like a monkey , or that the high bid is currently at $1025?
So, I haven't bombed a test that bad since my 2.0 semester.  Everyone walked out of there saying "WTF?" and "Did you have any clue what that test was about?".  That was a cruel joke to play, exacerbated by the fact the test was on a FRIDAY NIGHT.
I hate  urlLink Quark .   No, I loath the piece-of-ish software.  My job would be a breeze if it wasn't for the fact that the program won't print!
So, Sat and I went to a talk with  urlLink Theo de Raadt  today.  He discussed how OpenBSD came to be, how the original security audit worked, and how 'Secure by Default' works.  It was quite interesting even though I didn't learn much.  He is still someone to definitely look up to, someone to emulate.
I hate  urlLink MSU , so it feels great to have their team not win the championship again.  Then again, our program didn't even make the tournament...
Puking is the best way to start your day!  I got to see my bagel, tea and pills for a second time.  I am blessed.
I got sick of trying to find things on the  urlLink OpenBSD  site, so I configured my  urlLink search engine  to index both that site and mine.
The weather must be getting better because I am getting back into computer games.  Why is it that I never want to play them in the winter, but only when the weather is great?!  Anyway, Jenn came over last night and I showed her the wonder that is  urlLink Quake III .  Maybe I did something good to my machine lately, but the game seemed to run much much smoother then the last time I played.
Also, I broke down and bought  urlLink Deus Ex .  It's a first person shooter that has a great storyline and incorporates cybernetics.  What more could I wish for?
So, I completely formatted my hard drive again.  At least this time I had some sort of backup!   The purpose for this format was a brief interlude with  urlLink Solaris .  Since Solaris 8 does not support my GeForce video card, my resolution topped off at 640x480 in glorious black and white. Pathetically, Solaris doesn't support any of the video cards I have in my Box 'O Random Hardware.    The BORH is actually much lighter than usual since I offloaded 4 modems, 2 sound cards, 4 hard drives and 1 floppy drive on my grandfather.  I just hope I have enough hardware to build a spare computer...  Anyway,  urlLink eBay  might be the source for Solaris solace, since I could get a supported vid card for like $20.
The elusive  urlLink Red Ninja !  "Bad guys are for killing!"
I just got the full version of Deus Ex.  It's going to be a no-homework week.  Unfortunately, I should have bought this next week.  My second to last final is this Friday and my semester is over next Tuesday.
It's the last day of class, but there is massive construction going on at the Diag and the windchill is currently at 17 degrees.  I some how don't think that a lot of people are going to be running in this years Naked Mile.
We have all noticed that movies suck this year.  Momento has been the only movie I have deemed worth seeing all year, and even that wasn't great.  Let's hope the summer season picks things up.  There is a fairly large number of  urlLink animated films  coming out, including  urlLink Final Fantasy !
Oh man, this is great!   Okay, any of you that listens to Bad Religion knows the album Suffer.  The new NOFX album is going to be called Surfer, but it's only funny because of the cover art:
Well, another semester ends as does the era of another of my computers.  I have upgraded from an Asus P3V4X motherboard with 256 megs of PC133 ram and a 550MHz PIII (Overclocked to 623MHz).  The new system sports a Biostar (AKA cheap) motherboard with 256 megs of PC1600 DDR ram and a 900MHz Athlon (Overclocked to 1.017GHz).   My fastest Quake III demo numbers for the old system were around a max of 69.4 FPS.  The new system pulls around 106.9 FPS!   Nice.
Very unique, as web comics go:   urlLink When I am King .  I havent even finished reading it but I needed to share the love.

I've never been called a racist in my life, nor do I believe that I ever will.  When most people (especially men) are accused of being racist, they vehemently exclaim "But some of my friends are black!".  This may very well be true, but well assured that these 'black' friends act more 'stereotypically white' than the average.  I could almost say that I fall into this category.  Two friends of mine are just these sort of friends.  They have normal midwestern accents, wear t-shirts and average clothes you can find at the mall, etc etc.  Lastly, they have extreme public courtesy.  The public editor of the Chicago Tribune comments on the  urlLink lack of public courtesy  that some blacks have.  By the way, the editor is also black.  Does agreeing make me racist?  No, I equally discriminate against anyone that pisses me off.
So, I have to get up before 8 AM in Ann Arbor for the first time in almost 2 months.  This is due to a major server upgrade to the most important software package at work (gotta upgrade the only NT server to Service Pack  6a, then install a JVM for EJB).  Since I usually wake up around 11, breakfast is more a lunch issue.  Today, I decide to eat the remaining packets of Quaker Instant Oatmeal.  Open the package, what do I find?   Larvae!  The package was completely infested in some sort of insect.  Jamie almost puked, and I decided I wasn't so hungry anymore.
::Gasp, choke::  Cant.. breathe...     urlLink stinking pile of feces that is pop music ...  wearing me down...
Update to the  urlLink previous post  (OpenBSD):   urlLink OpenBSD 2.9  has been released.  My server at home and all the servers at work are now using it.  So far, I haven't noticed much of a change.  I guess they were all working so well with 2.8 that they can't get much better!  Most people say that the greatest change is the use of soft updates in the FFS filesystem.  Nothing is terribly IO intensive on these servers, so no changes have been noticed...
Update to the  urlLink previous post  (Java):  In the past 6 months I have flirted with  urlLink PHP ,  urlLink perl , and now  urlLink Java .   urlLink Michigandaily.com  is completely dependent on PHP, not only for displaying the pages but for creating the pages.  Using a cheap  urlLink iMac ,  urlLink perl , and a bunch of  urlLink OpenBSD  tricks, I created a backup server.  Good thing too, our web server died just two days ago!  As for Java, these skills are mostly for future consideration...
Update to the  urlLink previous post  (Pokemon):  The reason why I am playing Pokemon at all is because of  urlLink PvP .  Player vs. Player is another online comic that I am reading now.  Most of the characters talk about playing their favorite PC games (mostly FPSs like Quake III, Half-life, and UT).  A running gag is that the troll of the group, Skull, only plays Pokemon.  I read the entire  urlLink archive  and all of the mentions of Pokemon warped my mind.      For all of your having trouble with Pokemon Silver, here is a  urlLink walkthrough .  You can thank me later!
I have no shame.  A few days ago I was looking for emulators on the web.  Finding a free Gameboy emulator proved almost impossible but I found a  urlLink Java Gameboy emulator .  Other than the lack of sounds, it is quite amazing.  I started Java programming (Java, Java servlets, and JavaServer Pages) recently, and the code to the emulator is understandable and clean.  As with most applets, don't try to run it on a Mac; it crashed IE 5.  The next discovery was the No$ (no cash) emulator.  With a name like No$, I am thinking free.  Five minutes into playing  Pokemon , the game quits and the program pops up with "Pay us or you only get 5 minutes of playing at a time!!".  Bastards.  Didn't I say I had no shame?  Well, yes, the only reason I wanted these emulators was to play Pokemon!  And play Pokemon I have!  I have put over 8 hours into Pokemon Silver in the past three days.  Does that mean I found a free emulator?  No, but I found a way to circumvent the No$ 5 minute rule...   Want a copy?  Come and get  urlLink it .
So,  urlLink Blogger  has been eating my posts ever since I moved the website.  I made that move right around the time of that April 28th post.  The move was from the server stuck between two dressers in my bedroom (fireball) to the new 1U server in the server room at the Daily (queen).
Check the timestamp, I'm still at work!  Woohoo, going on 14 hours!
Today is one of the most frustrating days of my life.   urlLink Slashdot  has been down ALL day (which I usually check once an hour) and I have been at work for 10 hours now.   urlLink Mac OS Server X 10.0  needs to die.
After seeing how Fisher-Price-esque  urlLink Windows XP  has become and how it is horribly ripping off  urlLink Mac OS X , I just had to make this image.
Here are the things I will be learning about in the next few weeks:

urlLink Apache XML

Most people say this is  urlLink what I look like normally .
Possibly offensive acts and what certain religions think, all distilled down into a  urlLink single table .  Now you can see easily why the only religion I have ever followed was Buddhism.  (Link found in the  urlLink comments  section of Fark to a story about an  urlLink offensive ad .  The ad shows a Catholic man in the line for communion holding a bowl of onion dip.   Sweet.  Check out the comments for a scan of the ad.)
Sick of spending most of my days just trying to find something to keep myself busy, I have decided to get some certification.  The first one will be  A+ , which most people think is a joke.   I figure I can get this certification with no training.  It covers basic hardware skills and DOS/Windows skills.  The hardware portion is as basic as "Is this a power supply or a video card?", but gets a bit more difficult with "Is this RAM chip ECC or not?".  What they call the Operating Systems Technology is just an overview of DOS/NT/Win9x/Win2K.  The OS exam covers basic Windows installation, troubleshooting and networking.  If I can't pass these tests, my legacy as a failure will go down in history.  If (once) I pass these exams, I will try my hand at something actually difficult.  Too bad there isn't a generic sysadmin exam.  There are exams for  urlLink linux sysadmin ,  Redhat sysadmin ,  urlLink Solaris sysadmin , and  urlLink AIX sysadmin .  If there was a BSD sysadmin cert, I would be all over it.
I really shouldn't make this public already, but I created an  urlLink online scrapbook .  More specifically, this is a scrapbook for my high school class, created in PHP using MySQL.  Let's hope this is actually used.
My life just got infinitely better.  They finally restocked the Coke machine!  Cans of Diet Coke for only $0.45, rejoice.
I ended up working from 11 AM until 4:30 AM on Saturday/Sunday.  That's over 17 hours of work  straight .  Needless to say, my sleep cycle is completely erratic and my body is weak.  That didn't keep me from playing street hockey with  urlLink Eric  and about 15 little kids yesterday!
I broke the search engine earlier and since I switch servers so often, there is no point trying to rebuild it everywhere I go.  It's gone.
560 calories burned on the stationary bike.  Woohoo, I can go eat that Whopper now!
God damn it!  I hate forgetting that I have a website to deal with.  Let's see, what's been going on lately.  I have a potentially big project on my hands.  Basically, it is a complete rewrite of the Content Management System (CMS) I wrote for the  urlLink daily .  Now that I know the error of my ways from the first attempt at a CMS, I can do this one right.  So far, I have added (or plan on adding) a completely modular approach, automatic archiving, web-based configuration, a database backend and most importantly, the ability to create sites that have infinite depth.  Each template can reference a previous template, which could itself reference a previous template and so on.  Try writing a database for that one!  Other than that, life is good.
WTF?  The Wings picked up  urlLink Hasek ?
Throw 40 machines at a project, reap the results: I broke into the top 1000 on  urlLink Distributed.net .  That wasn't even using all of the machines at my disposal.  Lets see, what machines am I using?
i386
1.2GHz Athlon (Windows ME)
900MHz Athlon (OpenBSD 2.9)  (2 total)
800MHZ Duron (FreeBSD 4.3)
500MHz Pentium III (Windows 2000 Server)
366MHz Celeron (OpenBSD 2.9)
266MHz Pentium (OpenBSD 2.9)
200MHz Pentium (OpenBSD 2.9)
PPC
733 MHz G4 (Mac OS X Server 10.0.4)
533 MHz Dual G4 (Mac OS X Server 10.0.4)
500 MHz G4 (Mac OS 9.1)  (8 total)
400 MHz G3 (Mac OS 9.1)  (5 total)
266 MHz G3 (Mac OS 9.1)  (20 total)
That's 43 machines and 18.25GHz so far.  There are still 8 more iMacs (2.13GHz) that I am not using yet.  They won't help much, but it all adds up...
D'oh!  I forgot that  urlLink distributed.net  usually has a few projects at a time and that you have to configure your client if you want to work on one specific project.  All of my clients (all 30 of them) are now working solely on RC5.  About 600 work hours were spent on  urlLink OGR , WTF that is...
Flash of genius!  I don't know why I didn't think of this earlier.  Just watch  urlLink this page  over the next few weeks....
urlLink Controlling the users on a BSD box  just became so much clearer to me.
I, for one, am quite happy that Brunching Shuttlecocks  urlLink rates a random category  more often then once a week.

I hate the  urlLink Ann Arbor   urlLink Art   urlLink Fair .  The fair has yet to begin, but the annoyance flows strong today.  I live on South University, which is currently covered in canopies full of 'art'.  I work on Maynard, which is currently covered in canopies full of 'art'.  The places I eat, sleep and work are overrun, and the fair hasn't even started yet.  Life will get much worse when the tens of thousands of people begin to slowly crawl from canopy to canopy, either feigning a vague interest in the life work of an artist or exclaiming praise for the bravura.
urlLink 241st !   Ya know, I am not sure why my RC5 output is increasing so much lately.  I actually disabled the client on my main server at home.  The server is stuck between two dressers and has a second server sitting on top of it.  Needless to say, the air flow isn't so great and the temperature was simply too hot when running the proc at 100% 24/7.  Maybe someone else is cracking for me...   That would make for a pretty cool trojan/virus.  Have it simply install dnetc then attempt to infect other computers.  When it was finally discovered,  urlLink distributed.net  would be shut down, but hopefully not until I had won the $1000 prize.
I just found my  urlLink new cell phone .  I have put off buying one for almost a year now.  The pager provided by work is just not enough to keep my in touch with everyone.  I have had two instances where people needed to get in touch with me and the pager has failed.  The main problem is that the pager is connectionless communication.  Someone dails and number or sends an email, but they get zero confirmation that the page was actually received.  With a cell phone, you know if you get through instantaneously.  Pagers should be banned.
urlLink 288th !  Woohoo!
More exploits and fun.  DePaul university has not IP restricted their printers.  You can just ftp into any of these IPs and dump a print job:

Well, gotta love the errors of others.  Bugtraq was specifically told not to release  urlLink this code for a telnetd exploit , but now everyone has it.  I tested it on one of my servers (FreeBSD 4.3 release) and it worked.  It has to send  16 MEGS  of data to the target box, but it works.  Try it on your friends today!
Oh god,  urlLink these jokes  are disgustingly hilarious (or just hilarious and digusting?).
I got  urlLink farked  today, farked real good...  All because of a little  urlLink game poll  I put up.
So, I turned 21 last weekend, and what do I decide to do last night?  Go to Canada!  Not only is it still a mockery of a real country,  urlLink their money  has become true play money.  The $10 bill looks like a child when nuts with watercolors.
Hi kids, I haven't died.  This weblog is all but dead, but I am not.  Most of my time is being spent working on the backend of  urlLink this .

Two months ago, I would never have thought that a significant portion of my computing time would involve Linux.         This semester, I am in EECS 481, Software Engineering.  I would give you a link to the class homepage, but the professor decided the content isn't for the common man -- it's password protected.  The core of this class is a single, monolithic (redundant repetition, I know) project.  The only constrain to this project is that it must concern a certain  domain .  The domain for this semester is the software process.  How self-referential is that?  Our software project must be about the software process.
We decided on a project manager with some automatic environment creation scripts.  Basically, the manager of a software company would use a Windows front end to manage his developers.  He could see what projects they are working on, what experience they have, etc etc.  Whenever he had a new project, he could select which developers should work on it and click a single button to setup a few necessities:  A web site, mailing list and CVS repository for the new project.
We needed a server-class operating system for the backend.  Though I know  urlLink OpenBSD  fairly well (going on 2 years admin experience), we chose  urlLink RedHat  7.2.  The decision was made simply because of the greater install base of RedHat.
When I first started developing the backend scripts (I did it since no one else had the experience to correctly setup Majordomo and Apache, let alone know how to write Perl scripts), I used VMWare on my main machine.  VMWare made my life much easier as I tested these scripts.  Before I would do a new install of the scripts, I would backup my entire RedHat machine with two clicks.  If the install went haywire (which it often did), restoration was as simple.
Enter my new laptop: a used IBM Thinkpad 600.  Ever since I got this thing, I have taken it to every class and worked on code while the professors droned on and on.  I got the idea of working on the scripts while in class.  RedHat 7.2 installed beautifully.  Slowly but surely, my Windows XP partition is touched less and less.  The laptop boots into Linux by default.
Linux  and open source software has improved dramatically since I last used it (RedHat 6.2 days).  AbiWord reads most Word files cleanly (other than tables, bleh!),  urlLink Mozilla  0.9.9 is now my default browser EVERYWHERE (the Macs at work, my Windows XP machines, this laptop), and I just found a new love:   urlLink Ximian Red Carpet .  Think  urlLink Windows Update  on steroids.  I will be trying  urlLink Ximian Desktop  next.
Expect more reports on my new love.
Testing posting from Mozilla...   Success!
My possible classes for the Spring/Summer term:  Psych 370 (Abnormal Psych), Psych 380 (Introduction to Social Psychology), Philosophy 180 (Introduction to Logic), English 367 (Shakespeare's Principal Plays), Econoomics 101 (Microeconomics), or Economics 102 (Macroeconomics).  No, this is not an April Fool's joke.
How depressing.  Four years of college have gone by, many of my friends are graduating, and here I get ready to continue school for at least one more year.
I always have a horrible time trying to find the Remote Desktop client for older versions of Windows.  Microsoft changes their site so often that it is hard to keep up.  Hopefully this link stays alive for more than a month:   urlLink http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/rdclientdl.asp

Well, Sony dropped the price of the Playstation 2 to  urlLink $199 .  I still think that I got a great deal on my PS2:  PS2, 4 (four) (yes, four) controllers, memory card, and 10 games (Including Tekken Tag Tournament, Gran Turismo 3, Armored Core 2, Midnight Run, Madden 2001, NHL 2001, and Fantavision) for a whopping $225.  Beat that!
Strawberry jam is the best Jelly Belly flavor.  Well, second to Sizzling Cinnamon.

Since starting my new job back in April, I have had almost nothing to do.  I have found creative ways to make myself look busy but there are only so many hours a person can spend at  urlLink Slashdot  and  urlLink fark .    Well, today was given an actual assignment.  It is something simple (rebulid a laptop), but is it  actual work .  Now that I have gotten a taste of doing actual work, I don't want to go back to having to kill time.  I would rather coat my ass in honey and sit down on a seething pile of fire ants;  I would rather swallow a towel;  I would rather pound nails into my dick.
Another thing Mike hates:  People that use the word `read` in  place of `book`.  Such as " Son of a Grifter  was the most insanely fabulous   read   ever!"  Book, the word is book.  Thank you.
The scene:  Last night, 8:20PM, Mike's bedroom.  Mike, feeling ill from the burrito he ate earlier in the night, decides to lay down.  Cut to his alarm clock, not ringing, but clearly displaying the time as 7AM.  Cut back to Mike, groggy after 10.5 hours of sleep. Damn, being late for work sucks.
Forever changing "I fuck like a chimp" to "I fuck like a  urlLink toy dog ", quoth Chris.
So, today is Tuesday, which means that it is cool to like anything cool in the indie rock world.  Thus, I will add  urlLink  And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead  to my list of music to hunt down and devour.  It got a 10.  A fucking 10.  Pitchfork is usually full of shit, but a 10 is a commanding force.
New bands I need to find more music of:  Mudvayne, Taproot, White Stripes and The Hives.
Eric and I had planned on playing street hockey with the same bunch of people we played with a couple weeks ago.  Some of them were still learning to skate; none of them had played street hockey for more than a couple months.  Needless to say, the games were fun and low on competition.  Today, none of them could make it.  Knowing that lots of people play at Elbel field, we headed down there.  About 8 guys were playing and there was an 9 year old boy trying to keep up with them.  Seeing such a group, we knew they couldn't have been too good.  Turns out, they were all better than the two of us, but we held our own.    After an hour and a half of playing, a few more guys showed up.   Slowly as these people started to sub in, Eric and I noticed how outclassed we were.  I thought they were just good amateurs with a cocky attitude.  When we finally left, Eric told me he found out that they were on the UMich hockey team!  Man.  No wonder.
After the heat of the past few days, this evening breeze is amazing.  I think a cool breeze is one of the most relaxing feelings possible.  It is so relaxing that I feel more at peace.
So the man leans over to me and whispers:  "Neutral Milk Hotel The Microphones The Shins The Dismemberment Plan Need New Body The Mountain Goats Boards of Canada ... and You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead Sparklehorse Belle &amp; Sebastian Brighteyes Matmos The Hot Snakes The White Stripes". And so it shall be done.
Got NS 4.7 and DNS working on my Sun box.  Wow, the site looks like poop.  That's okay though, since I might be redesigning in the next couple weeks.  I know  urlLink who  we can thank for that.
My page is now HTML 4.01 Transitional and CSS compliant.  Does anyone still use Netscape 4.7?  I made some other changes to the layout, so it is very possible that the site is broken in NS 4.7.  The only machine I have that has NS 4.7 is my Sun box, but I can't seem to get DNS lookups to work properly...
I only watched one show this year (other than SportsCenter, but all males watch that so it doesn't count),  urlLink 24 .  How, in the name of baby Jesus, did it  urlLink rank  below The Chair and just above Spin City?  Good thing there is going to be a second season.  If it got  urlLink deleted  like so many other shows this year, I would cry.
Simpsons fan rejoice:   urlLink Albuquerque's baseball team next year will be the Isotopes .
If you can see this, you can see the new design.
Plans for the evening?  Why yes, thank you:   Two year anniversary dinner around 6:30 PM  Wings game at 8 PM  Miles from Home, playing at the Blind Pig around 11 PM  There might be other plans tonight, but I am trying to keep this blog rated PG-13.
Two years!
urlLink NHL.com :  Igor Larionov is 41. Chris Chelios is 40. Dominik Hasek, Brett Hull and captain Steve Yzerman are 37. Luc Robitaille and Steve Duchesne are 36. Fredrik Olausson is 35. Nine Red Wings players are older than Carolina Hurricanes coach Paul Maurice, who is 35.   urlLink Detnews.com : Yes, the Wings have the NHL's oldest roster. Scotty Bowman is 68. Carolina Coach Paul Maurice is 35, younger than nine Wings players.
urlLink Squid /2.3.STABLE5 is poopoo.  Hopefully this installation of Squid/2.5PRE7 works better.
Personally, I always thought that vegetarian food was more healthy for you.  In a browsing spree, I ended up at the  urlLink Jimmy John's website .  I used to get their #6 (basic veggie sub) all of the time, but switched to the #5 (the Vito, an Italian sub comprised of salami, capicola, provolone, veggies and vinaigrette) after my first taste.  The site has  urlLink nutritional information .  The Vito weighs in at 24 grams of fat and 562 calories.  The veggie weighs in at 35 (!) grams of fat and 671 calories.  When I first started eating at Jimmy John's my freshman year (4 years ago, sigh), I always got the Gargantuan.  46 grams of fat and 892 calories.  Ooops.
And  urlLink again .  LiveJournal should not be used for such dirty, dirty histrionics.
Please,  urlLink make it stop .  If these girls had nuts, I would headbutt them there.
Even better?       urlLink     Ok, I have ping-ponged between HTML 4.01 Transitional and XHTML 1.0 Strict about 4 times now.  Basically, I couldn't have the page be both valid XML and be parsed by PHP.  Well, just adding a
&lt;?php
header("Content-type: text/xml");
?&gt;
helped it get through the validator.  The page works in Mozilla, but IE 6 shows it as raw XML!  Forget it, I am going to stick with HTML.
Did you know that you still need to pay parking meters after 10 PM?  Did you know that there are handicapped meters?  (I bet you know where I am going with this one).   Laura is sick and last night she asked if I could bring her some sorbet.  I parked on South University (in Ann Arbor) about three blocks from her apartment and right between an ice cream shop (Stucchi's) and a store (Village Corner).  I got the sorbet, dropped it off, visited for about 15 minutes and went back to my car.  In my door handle I was greeted with a $75 fine!  I am pretty sure I will be able to appeal this ticket.      I am still not sure if you have to pay a meter after 10 PM.  Most university meters are only checked until 6 PM.  I had no idea that handicap-only meters exist.  Since I didn't think I had to put money in the meter, I didn't see that this was a handicap-only meter.  I was getting ice cream for my sick girlfriend!
And, once again,   urlLink    and  urlLink   .
The new design should be live for everyone now.   urlLink Old  versus  urlLink New , what do you think?  It does not work in Netscape 4, but that was expected given the large amount of CSS involved.
Point of the following story:  We gambled and won!  Eric's sister decided to go to  urlLink Joe Vision  last night to see game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals.  Since Eric is leaving for Alaska on the 18th, we have been trying to hang out as much as possible.  The two of us decided to meet his sister and her friends down in Detroit.    Since we left just after I got home from work, I was starving.  We both thought of what quick and cheap restaurants were on the way from Ann Arbor to downtown Detroit.  One restaurant shone above the rest:   urlLink White Castle !  There is a White Castle at Telegraph road just off 96.  Obviously, you can't go to White Castle without getting burgers, but we also caved into the novelty of Chicken Rings.  They are tasty and easy to eat; the perfect food.  While there, this fairly large female bus driver asked us both "How do you keep your feet so purdy?".  I said something about how my feet weren't 'purdy' and that they were also burnt from being out in the sun all day yesterday.  She didn't care, as she continued to comment on our toes and heels.  Foot fetish in a White Castle, I know.  Back to food:  between the two of us, we had 8 burgers, 9 chicken rings, 2 orders of fries and a couple Cokes.  During the first period at the Joe, my stomach was in a raging battle against said food items.  I won, if only for the fact that I didn't have to poop at JLA.  That is a decisive win against White Castle.
urlLink Neverwinter Nights  is out!  A friend, his girlfriend and my roommate all bought copies on the first day.  Thankfully, I got to play for about an hour yesterday.  The single player mode is a bit dry so far, but I only played for an hour!  I really can't decide whether or not I like it.  The interface is a bit clunky due to the Sims-esque circular navigation.  If you haven't played either of these games, the navigation starts by clicking on an object (right-clicking for NWN).  The click brings up circular icons in a circular pattern around whatever you clicked.  You are then required to click on one of these circular icons.  If there is more than one such level of navigation, a new set of circular icons in a circular pattern pops up.  If not, then your selection has been made.  Belanger and I discussed the merits of this game and decided that multiplayer games with a DM on an isolated server are where this game will shine.  People are going to start making modules soon, too.  This could be the next Counterstrike.
I saved myself $100 yesterday!  I bought a fairly nice Sony CD Walkman last summer (the previous version of  urlLink this model ).  I only used it probably 30 times since I bought it, mostly working out.  Back in the day, I would bring a CD player wherever I would do homework, but now I just bring my  urlLink laptop .  Well, sometime last semester, something in my CD player broke.  The lid would never stay shut.  If the lid is open, the player automatically turns off.  Yesterday, I probably killed two hours just looking at new CD players.  I finally decided on  urlLink this one  since it is a Sony, thin, and can play MP3s.  Yes, it's in girly blue, but I like girly blue!  (You should see some of the shirts I have...)  Before ordering it, I thought I might as well try to fix my old player.  How could it hurt?  I was going to buy a new one anyway!  I ripped it open, moved the lever a bit and it worked!   Well, by "worked" I mean the lid would stay shut.  I got all excited and decided to go work out, just to try it out.  After changing, getting a Nalgene bottle ready and downing some Creatine (you think I am joking?), I tossed some batteries into the old player.  Nothing.  Press play.  Nothing.  Sigh.  I ripped it open *again*.  I couldn't see anything wrong, though I did have to disconnect a cable to reset the lever.  I reseated said cable.  Nothing.  Just then, I noticed a little piece of plastic sitting in my lap.  How it stayed there for the fifteen minutes between when I first opened the player to when I noticed it is beyond me.  I figured where it went (another lever that pushed down a little button when the lid is closed) and wham.  I was off to the  urlLink CCRB  listening to  urlLink Trail of Dead .

urlLink Apache admins screwed by premature vuln report   I would attach some insightful commentary, but I just got swamped at work.
Perl is frustrating me.  Stupid websites are frustrating me.  Whenever a site doesn't include a feature I need, I usually end up including it for them.   urlLink OpenBSD.org  doesn't have a search engine, so I fired up  urlLink ht://Dig .  Now, a certain music review site lists old reviews alphabetically.  What a mess!  I am trying to use perl to spider through the entire site and dump most of the info to a database.  The main perl module for web data harvesting is  urlLink LWP , but it took me about 3 hours to get it installed.  It has 35,836 different dependencies and it just would NOT install on an OpenBSD 3.0 box through CPAN.  I finally got it to work using CPAN on a 3.1 box.  I should have tried the port first, but oh well.  More to come.
In my opinion, once you hit the age of 22, no one will still consider you young.  21 is an odd age:  you are old enough for almost all responsibilities but society does not consider you an adult.  This summer I will hit 22 and it is about time to start saving for my retirement.  With the little research I have been doing so far, there have been two main points driven into me:  Diversify your portfolio.  Have a 6-12 month cushion in liquid assets in case of emergency  Most households have less than a years worth of income in  total  wealth.  ( urlLink Actual values :  Income:  $42,148.  Wealth:  $40,200.)  How scary is that?
I might be selling my laptop soon. (Thanks, but I already have a buyer).  Should I drop 2 large and get a new Dell?  Even with the money I will get for the old laptop, that is still a paycheck and a half!  Here are my requirements for a used laptop:  Pentium III (thus, 450MHz or better)  256 megs of ram  5 gig hard drive  14" or larger LCD screen that supports at least 1024x768  DVD drive  10/100 network port  A working battery!  All for under $750  If something like that shows up on eBay, I am all set.   urlLink These guys  just might have something I am looking for...
There just might be a chance for  urlLink the rest of the West to catch up with the Wings , but don't hold your breath.
I just found them so they aren't going on the side bar just yet:   urlLink Aversion   (punk and indie news)and  urlLink Faction Radio  (post punk, indie, emo and punk internet radio).
Note to self:  stop linking to Pitchfork.  There is something about the singing of a soft, little girl voice that will transfix me on the spot.  It is vaguely reminescent of, what seems to be, a previous life.  I cannot explain what it does to me;  I feel at peace.  I can close my eyes and feel that I am floating through an opaque peach sky, weightless.   urlLink Saloon  is doing this to me right now.  Make it hurt.
Alright, Fark got me.  The headline  urlLink Crack found in 2 shuttles, NASA grounds the whole fleet  had nothing to do with drugs.

One of the oldest questions in history is, "What came first, the chicken or the egg?" One of the oldest answers to that question was given by Aristotle, who stated that it was, in fact, the chicken. The philosopher postulated that while a chicken is an actual chicken, an egg is potential chicken. Since actuality always precedes potentiality, the chicken came first.
I just renewed bibik.org at godaddy.com.  Why godaddy?  Register.com was charging $35/year, godaddy is charging $9/year.  The domain expires on the 17th, so here's to hoping that the transfer goes through in time.  Otherwise, I wouldn't be surprised if I have to find a new domain!  Bibik.org, bibik.net, bibik.com and bibik.biz (yeah, don't ask me) are all taken.  mikebibik isn't taken in any form, but I don't want anything so specific.
Well kids, yesterday was the 4th of July and what did I do?  Nothing.  Why did I do nothing?  Because I was tired.  I was tired because of work.  I work because I need money.  I need money because I like to buy stuff.  I like to buy stuff because it gives me something to do.  Fuck.
I finally broke down and signed up for the  urlLink A+ hardware certification exam .  $140!  That cost wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to take  two  such exams to get the A+ certification.
Music makes me cry and I can't help but smile whenever I see a baby.  I am so damned old.
I finally broke down and decided that my Ann Arbor apartment is just too hot.  When I brought a digital thermometer upstairs and registered  93.8  degrees, that's when I knew it was time to go back to Livonia for awhile.  Central AC is worth sacrificing my computer and my liberties, if for just a little while.
Speaking of speed, my typing speed is now over 80 WPM.   urlLink Test yourself !
So, I passed the A+ hardware exam.  This exam is scheduled for 30 minutes and I finished it in 6.  There should be a bonus for finishing in 1/5th of the allotted time.
It's funny, the more things that happen in my personal life, the less I post here.  It is just not worth the hassle to let the world know my deeper thoughts.
Hmm, even though it looks down right now, here are some examples from an  urlLink IRC quotes page :
&lt;Chirako&gt; You know what cereal is really nasty?
&lt;Chirako&gt; Gravy Train.
&lt;Chirako&gt; It's like, these little hard pieces of bran and crumbly beef flavored crap.  You pour water over it, and it gets soggy and makes gravy around it.
&lt;Disco_Ernie&gt; Chirako..that's...dog food..
&lt;Chirako&gt; It was NOT dog food!
&lt;Chirako&gt; Mommy wouldn't feed me dog food!
* Chirako looks at Mommy
&lt;Chirako&gt; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
&lt;Chirako&gt; IT'S DOG FOOD!
&lt;Chirako&gt; http://www.gravytraindog.com/
&lt;Chirako&gt; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!
&lt;Chirako&gt; She's always been obsessed with me eating dog food... &gt;_&lt;
&lt;Chirako&gt; When I was little, she told me the Jerky Treats were real jerky, and I kept eating the whole bag
* Chirako gags
&lt;Chirako&gt; If there's one thing dogs love, it's rich,
&lt;Chirako&gt; beefy gravy. That's why every nugget of
&lt;Chirako&gt; Gravy Train is basted in real beef juices.
&lt;Chirako&gt; Just mix it with warm water, and you can
&lt;Chirako&gt; give your dog a warm homestyle meal,
&lt;Chirako&gt; dripping with the delicious gravy he loves.
* Chirako graons
&lt;Chirako&gt; Oh, man.... I'm gonna kill her
&lt;Disco_Ernie&gt; At least Chirako will have:
&lt;Disco_Ernie&gt; Healthy skin
&lt;Disco_Ernie&gt;  Glossy coat
&lt;Disco_Ernie&gt;  Strong teeth and bones
&lt;Disco_Ernie&gt;  Builds and maintains body tissue
&lt;Disco_Ernie&gt;  Efficient digestion
&lt;Disco_Ernie&gt;  Clear eyes
&lt;Chirako&gt; ..I should have known.
&lt;Chirako&gt; She NEVER makes me breakfast
&lt;stank&gt; guys.. i went out tonight.
&lt;stank&gt; i pretended to be a normal college student.
&lt;stank&gt; and i stood uncomfortably on a porch with a bunch of people i don't know.
&lt;stank&gt; but then i ran into bill and will, who were pretending in the same way.
&lt;stank&gt; so we talked about networks and i felt better.

&lt;Paradox&gt; So, guys, I have some news.
&lt;Paradox&gt; I know I usually don't talk much about stuff unless it's solid, but this is interesting, and I think you should know.
&lt;Paradox&gt; I just got an E-mail about an interesting proposition.  * volsung_ perks up.
&lt;Paradox&gt; Apparently, there are lesbians that want my 'hard cock.'
* volsung_ flips Paradox the bird.
&lt;volsung_&gt; :)
&lt;Paradox&gt; They want it 'now,' apparently, so the timetable is somewhat limited.
&lt;volsung_&gt; Are you going to just take their offer as presented, or is there an opportunity for negotiation?
&lt;Paradox&gt; I'm not sure.
&lt;volsung_&gt; I'm sure your hard cock is in great demand.  An exclusive deal might not be in your best interest.
&lt;Paradox&gt; Last time I got an offer like this, there were some catches.

Again, this is my link depository.  I don't want to forget about this  urlLink how-to about OpenBSD and VPNs .
Since I started working a normal job (7 AM - 4 PM, Monday through Friday), I have been going to bed by 11 PM at the latest (yeah, soy un perdedor).  This morning was the second half of my A+ certification exam.  So, instead of studying last night, I went to the bar and drank 2 pints of  urlLink Bass  on an empty stomach.   I went to bed drunk around 12:30 AM, didn't study in the morning and still passed.   Ahh, the college life.
My recent meals:
Yesterday
Breakfast:  Corn Pops and coffee with 1 day-past-due milk
Lunch: 2 inches of an Italian sub from Quiznos

Today
Breakfast:  Corn Pops and coffee with 2 day-past-due milk
Lunch: Can't eat, going to puke.
I *love* worthless data!  While writing an email, I scanned my desk and observed that there were more empty cans of Diet Pepsi than of Diet Coke.  My tastes are changing (in so many ways).  Curioius as to what was the most popular "soft drink", I found this  urlLink data :

Lets see, what's been going on lately?  I scheduled the second portion of the A+ certification exam for this Thursday.  If the difficulty of this exam is on par with the first portion, I have already passed.  All of the interns are going to a  urlLink Tigers  game on Tuesday.  I have only been to a handful of baseball games in my life and this will be the first time I have gone to the new stadium.  Honestly, I hope all the money that is being dumped into Detroit does some good.  Compuware is moving their headquarters down there, we have the casinos now, Ford Field will be the new home of the Lions, etc etc.  Time will tell, as will the census.  If the population reaches a million again, that is a good sign.  I saw UFC 38 last night.  The only fight that was truly interesting was Genki Sudo versus Leigh Remedios.  Sudo came out looking like a WWE wrestler, so I already hated him.  When the fight started, he was throwing out taunts like candy and just acting cocky.  Turns out, this ploy worked as it threw off Remedios' game.  Sudo finished him with a lightning fast rear naked choke.  Now I like this guy.  Speaking of UFCs and Detroit, Chris was telling me that the one that was held in Detroit was a complete disgrace.  To allow the fights in Michigan, there could be no punching.  How is that mixed martial arts?  The pay-per-view numbers were *halved* for the next UFC.  Good job, Detroit.  The tag line for UFC 38 was "Brawl in the Hall", as it was held at Royal Albert Hall in the UK.  Chris and Marty couldn't remember the tag line for the Detroit UFC, so we decided it had to be "Motor City Mayhem", "Motown Showdown" or "D-town Beatdown".  So cheesy.

One of my coworkers is really into home automation.  He showed me how his entire house is controllable through the web.  It even keeps logs of all the activity.  A lot of geeks are worried about the uptime of their servers.  His house has a whole list of uptimes such as "Living Room Lamp 1, In the OFF state for 1 day, 13 hours, 5 minutes and 36 seconds".  He can tell when the garage door is open, who has called and how long they talked, the temperature of each room, etc etc.  He uses  urlLink HomeSeer  software and a lot of products from  urlLink smarthome.com .  You know those damned X10 pop-under ads?  Well, it turns out that X10 is actually a protocol for home automation and that no one that does home automation really buys from the official X10 company.  Back to that "entire house is controllable through the web" bit:  Combine an always-on DSL connection and a weak password, and someone can hack your house.  Tip:  don't use your first name as your username with a single repeating character as your password.

So, I get home from work a bit late today, 5 PM to be more exact.  As I pull into my parking lot, I hear a cacophony of high pitched squeals and beeps.  Annoyed though intrigued, the sounds seemed familiar.  As I get closer to my apartment door, I realize almost simultaneously that the sound is coming from my apartment and is the sound of six smoke detectors going off at once.  Can someone cautiously bust into an apartment?  I did just that.  No smoke.  IRON ON AN IRONING BOARD!  But it was cool and non-burning.  RUN UPSTAIRS.  Nothing.   W h a t  t h e  h e l l . . .    The usual way to get the damned smoke detectors is to find the one that is being set off and then flagellate a large cloth object (usually a bath towel) in its general direction.  No smoke means no amount of flagellating will help.  By this point, I am almost completely deaf.  The sound is so much, I cannot even tell where it is coming from any more.  All of the detectors are on the same circuit, so I started disconnecting them one by one.  Being just under 6 foot tall, the detectors were *just* out of my reach to be grabbed down and disconnected.  Damn it all, I just started ripping them down cautiously (again, if possible).  I got 5 of them (the sixth was already disconnected) but the sound continued!  I was so deaf that I couldn't tell if the ones I had just removed and tossed to the floor were still sounding or if there was a hidden detector, or if the sound was all in my head.  After an eternity of going nuts, the detectors timed out and the silence was deafening.  None of my roommates were home, there was no smoke, it made no sense.  Thinking of how great my luck is, I knew that if I left all of the detectors disconnected there *would* be a fire.  Replaced the two downstairs:  no problem.  Replaced the one in the upstairs hall: no problem.  Replaced the ones in the other bedrooms:  no problem.  Replace the one in my bedroom:  FUCKING DEAFENING CACOPHONY GETS REVENGE.  You know that little confused path that people comicly take when they don't know where to go or what to do?   You know, rush off in one direction, quickly reverse, spin around in a circle then just charge forward?  I did just that, in my own room, in my own apartment.  Ripped down the detector in my room and the sound stopped.  All of this chaos because a single smoke detector isn't working properly.  I still can't hear right.

&lt;Crazy Waiter Story&gt; So, after Chris' amateur martial arts fight in Rochester Hills on Saturday, we all went to Red Robin in Novi.  We knew our waiter had lost it when our first impression of him was seeing him dance to YMCA with extreme fervor.  Over the course of the night, he asked us if we had ever been to Philadelpia (all because the Rocky theme song was being played), asked us if we liked the Shining (all because of a picture of Jack Nicholson with glowing eyes), explained the entire story of the Shining (even though we all knew it), forgot Lauras drink, forgot Lauras food, then gave us an extra pitcher of beer to make up for his insanity.  His excuse was that he had been working since 10 AM (and it was already midnight).  My reasoning states that he is always like that in a ploy to get better tips. &lt;/Crazy Waiter Story&gt;
"If you could change one thing about yourself what would it be?":    I honestly wish I was more naturally outgoing.  I may seem outgoing, but it's not always me.  When I was younger, I was very shy.  With my friends in my neighborhood, I was a normal kid.  In school, I was pretty damned quiet.  Every year in elementary school, I was in some sort of accelerated program.  Not with other kids, but they would make something up for me.  When I was in first grade, I had to go to one of the second grade classrooms for reading.  Stuff like that.  That definitely made me an outcast.  I had very few friends at school, and until I started playing sports during recess I rarely hung out with anyone.  I was still very quiet until 9th grade.  At that point, I more or less forced myself to be outgoing.  I started cracking jokes, being a loudmouth, being very opinionated, etc etc.  It still feels like a show, a farce, to this day.

The English language just has to go.  There are too many inconsistancies and annoyances.  Why must both the present and past tense of "to receive or take in the sense of (as letters or symbols) especially by sight or touch" be "read"?  Obviously, that's is fine for the spoken word, but not for written!
Twice in three days:   Chris and I were mucking around with his OpenBSD firewall, trying to recover data from a dead drive.  This box is his firewall, file and NAT server.  Without this box, no internet.   While we were waiting for it to reboot, I was thinking of things to do.  "Oh, go to www.somesite.com."  "Uh...".   D'oh, right, no internet access.     Just today, I had to restart my web proxy.  "What can I do while I wait for the web proxy?  Ah, go to slashdot!"  Uh... Right, again, no internet access.  Is it a bad sign when you just assume that you have a 24/7 broadband connection?

Geek humor (in reference to anti-gravity), curtesy of  urlLink Slashdot :   Since we all know that   1. Cats always land on their feet, and  2. A buttered slice of bread will undoubtedly land on the carpet butter side down,   we could strap said buttered slice of bread onto the cats back, then drop the whole thing to the floor.  Retort:  This fails both under quantum physics and general relativity.  Under the quantum physics interperetation, since both the cat's feet and the buttered toast are equally likely to land on the floor, the cat-toast enters a superposition where both cat and toast are simultaneously on the floor until it is observed, at which point a radioactive particle decays, and the cat is skinned in a number simultaneous, equally likely, yet distinct ways.  Relativity predicts that the intense attraction to the floor will, in fact, bend space-time in such a way that the floor actually is in contact with both the cat and the toast. If the cat is of the black variety, then it will thus cross its own path, generate a singularity, and vanish in a puff of logic.  The debate continues, as attempts at experimental verification have thus far failed. Dr. Kibble at Princeton's IAS said "Look, have YOU ever tried to hold a cat still and strap some friggin' TOAST to its back?"

I apologize for the lack of posts lately.  I had to give a presentation concerning my summer internship at Yazaki North America.  Instead of doing what everyone else was doing (using Powerpoint), I decided to use  urlLink Flash .  That required *learning* Flash first.  I spent about 3 hours on the presentation itself and 40 hours on learning Flash.  I think it was worth it.  See the final result  urlLink here  (The page numbers are used as front and back buttons).

I was only awake for about 50 minutes today, my 22nd birthday, when I got my first present!  At about 7:55 AM, I heard my car alarm go off.  That could mean only one thing, I was getting towed again!  I scampered down there, barefoot, just as the tow truck guy was putting braces on my rear wheels.  Seems that my forged permit was fading so fast that it was quite obvious.  Just yesterday I noticed that the text was a lot closer to yellow than to the expected red.  Long story short, the tow truck guy remembered how nice I was the last time he tried to tow me, so he let me go with just a $40 fee.  Come to think about it, I only paid $120 this entire summer to park in my lot ($80 fee a month ago, $40 fee today).  Not bad for four months of parking!

urlLink So true .  Ever since I started working 7AM - 4PM, my caffeine intake has doubled.  Mind you, it was horribly high before.  Now, I average about 72 ounces of pop (usually Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi) and 45 ounces of coffee.  That must be how I can type so fast.  I don't actually type, I just vibrate over the keyboard.
So I finally moved out of 214 N Thayer, Penthouse C, last night.  I had to make three car loads back to my parents house in Livonia and one truck load to Matt's place in Ann Arbor for everything!

Here is a little perl script that I wrote for work over the past couple days.  Basically, our E10K (named CAD) had a hardware failure and the Oracle database struggled to come back up afterward.  The senior UNIX admin was having trouble getting a Korn shell script to correctly report whether or not a process was running.  Originally, this perl script would just grep the process list for one specific process and then shoot off an email to a list of admins.  Now, it will look for any number of processes and send emails to any number of specified admins.  The comments should explain it all.  The only line that might need some explanation is this one:  foreach $recipient_number (@{$process_recipient_bridge[$process]}) { process_recipient_bridge is an array of arrays (or list of lists, if you will).  I want to get access to one of those internal lists.  To get a single element in an array of arrays, you would use $array[index1][index2].  To get a whole array out, you still use $array[index1], but then you have to cast that as an array:  @{$array[index1]}.  If you want to run this on a BSD, OS X or Linux system, make sure that you change "ps -ef" to "ps -ax" and "mailx" to just "mail".

So, my favorite field is finally starting to produce fruit:  urlLink I Can See  ( urlLink Wired cover ).  Ever since I read all 5 pages of this article this morning, my mind has been awhirl.    First, the techology behind this is amazing.  The camera, not amazing.  The computers, not amazing.  The software, not amazing.  The neural implant, bingo.  If you have read the article, you will know that this implant sits directly atop the visual cortex.  The resolution is not that high, but it does allow the user to perceive objects.    Second, I am rethinking my future plans again.  Cybernetics is now, the proof is here!  This is just the beginning, this is just what the public knows.  I am sure that many of my dreams will be realized by the end of my lifetime (which should hopefully coincide with the end of this century).  Why should I limit myself to basic computer support work my entire life?  Why should I try to get an MBA and join the management track before I am 28?  Technology and cybernetics are two true loves.  Repairing vision (of this fashion) is simple in comparision to what is possible!  Maybe I should have stuck with my plan to become a biomedical engineer.  Too bad UMich didn't offer a BME undergraduate degree when I was applying.  Third, I really want to watch  urlLink Ghost in the Shell  again.

When I meet someone new, eventually the conversation will turn toward basic formalities.  One of these formalities is usually in the form of the question "What are you majoring in?", asked after they find out I am in college.  My answer, "Biology and computer science.", is always countered with one of two responses:  ::Hesitation, look of confusion::  "Really...  That's different."  -OR-
Another tool for my Hack Recovery Disk:   urlLink Busybox , a single executable that replicates much of the functionality of many GNU utilities.
A new project I would like to work on:    A simple BSD or Linux boot disk that contains a few utilities for testing for a hacked box.  Initially, the system administrator would boot off this floppy and run the initialization utilitity.  It would take an MD5 hash of all the files in specific directories (such as /etc, /bin, /sbin and /usr/bin) and store the results in a text file.  Later on, the system administrator could boot off this floppy again and run the comparison utility.  It would take another MD5 hash of all the files and compare the results.  Doing this in BSD would be easier for me because I have access to many BSD machines.  Doing it in Linux would make it much more widely supported.  Can the stock Linux kernel mount FFS file systems?  I know OpenBSD can mount Ext2 file systems.  Red Hat now uses Ext3 by default, so it would only work with older RH systems.  Hopefully I will be able to create a boot disk that would work with most any unix system.  This project could also use  urlLink Tripwire  or a  urlLink pre-made system disk .  Or maybe I will just do it all from scratch just to be a jerk.
Wow, I'll be damned.  You know how I said there were two main singers for that crappy opening band, Cuda?  Well, turns out, the guy with the better voice is Gar Wood from the Hot Snakes.  I just thought the regular bassist was taking some time off, so the guy from the Cudas joined them.  It's completely the other way around.  No wonder I was so confused, and no wonder there was such conflict, and no wonder his voice is that much better.
Ahh, for the want of broadband at home:     urlLink Hot Snakes live shows ,  urlLink slick Music Videos .
Laura and I went to the Hot Snakes show last night at the Magic Stick.  Neither of us had been there, so we had a bit of difficultly parking.  We found the actual place just fine, but we had to settle for street parking a couple blocks away.    To summarize the Magic Stick:  Hellhole.  The main room isn't too bad, though a bit run down.  The pool tables are all 7 footers, and are thus worthless.  The bartender was quite the jerk, but what else would I expect?  The bathroom was, by far, the worst of it all.  Laura was so disgusted by the her bathroom that she wouldn't even describe it.  The mens room had two stalls and two urinals, yet no stall doors or seats even.  The funniest part was there was just a random roll of toliet paper sitting toward the middle of the room.  Who would use that?  No door, no seat, just a random roll sitting in the filth of many punks?  I will pass.  Strike one.  I knew there were supposed to be two opening bands, but I figured they would start playing soon after the doors opened.  We got there at 7:30 PM, the doors didn't open until 8 PM, yet we waited and waited and waited.... The first band (Red Hot Legends) finally started at 9:30 PM!  They sucked.  Musically, not bad.  Their vocalist, on the other hand, was so horrid that we couldn't understand a single lyric.  Strike two.  A good 40 minutes after the first band screeched to a halt, the second band (The Cudas) got on stage.  Musically, pretty basic without flourish, melodical but plodding.  The band had two main singers and a female backup singer/keyboardist.  You could just tell the two guys were vying for top spot in the band.  The guy who called the shots was a cheesy chach, the other guy had a much better voice.  Gotta love band conflict.  Their lyrics though, simply pathetic.  Strike three.  Finally, praise god, the Hot Snakes got on stage sometime after 11 PM.  I am not even sure when they started, my eyes were watering because I was so over tired.  Without any build up or chatting with the audience, they launched into I Hate the Kids.  I was a bit unsure of their quality live at first, but then I think their sound engineer tweaked something.  The sound was very faithful to the albums, but with pure raw energy.  They also played 10th Planet, Automatic Midnight, If Credit Matters I'll Take Credit, Light Up The Stars, No Hands, Our Work Fills The Pews, Past Lives, Gar Forgets His Insulin, XOX, Who Died, Suicide Invoice and Ben Gurion (wow, I remembered almost all of them).    Laura and I actually left during their show because I was so tired.  Hopefully I didn't miss much.  Luckily, I got to hear my favorite three songs (I Hate The Kids, If Credit's What Matters I'll Take Credit and Suicide Invoice).  It's so hard to rock out when you have to get up before 6 AM the next day.  The show was amazing, thus all strikes are taken back.
You know what sucks about 60 gig drives?  Defragging.
And I thought acid was bad:  Laura's older sister Carolyn was housesitting/catsitting for some friends these past two weeks.  15 days of this, which was supposed to end yesterday.   Since the couple was supposed to be back last night, Carolyn went home.   She got a phone call around 11 PM from the FIRE MARSHALL.     It seems that the dryer caught on fire and burned up half of the basement.  They found her cell phone number on a note upstairs and called her.   Luckily the fire caused a water pipe to rupture, helping quench the flames.  She was okay, the cats were okay, no one was hurt.   More luck for that family.
And I thought wasps were bad:  Laura works at the School of Public Health as a lab technician.  The lab she works in deals with air purity/polution.  The air and water samples they collect are stored in generic glass bottles.  To insure that these bottles are free from impurities, they are washed in acid, baked in acid then cleaned with various other techniques.    Just the other day, Laura was doing the usual routine of cleaning bottles when she accidentally dropped a bottle of acid into a sink.  The acid bottle was open since she was using it, thus acid splashed up and into her EYE.  She immediately used the eye wash, which I believe saved her.  Though she could see just fine after it happened, she decided to go to the ER just to be sure.  They flushed both eyes with a liter of saline each then examined the damage.  Just a small amount of corneal abrasion which healed quickly.  Thank god.

The things a boy will do for internet access:   As most of you know, I am back at my parents house for two weeks this summer.  During this time, my only home net access will be dial up.  This would be bearable if I could actually make a connection!  I dial up my umich account and the connection will die within 20 minutes (usually after only 1 minute).    I called up Ameritech and they said it could be a problem with the line, or it could be internal wiring.  If the wiring was the case, then they would charge us just to come look at the problem.  He suggested that I connect a modem directly into the interface on the outside of the house.  Problem, my computer is in the basement.  Luckily, I am sometimes smart.    I found a phone cord long enough so that I could run it from the external interface, through the bathroom window and then *down* the laundry chute into the basement.  Unluckily, the external interface is behind a  urlLink rose of sharon  bush (Hibiscus syriacus).  Guess what likes to hang out around these bushes?  Wasps!  I got stung four times, including twice *in the face*.  All for dial up access.
Laura and I were discussing life plans and money.  I came to the conclusion that I don't really need a new sports car when I graduate from college.  She made the point that it would be better to waste a bit of money now than buying a 'Vette and a Harley when I hit 45.  Thus:    urlLink

D'oh, I forgot to tell you *why* all of my projects have been aborted.  I am resodding my parent's front lawn.  It's a fireball of fun, I assure you.  Here is a little list I whipped up of the steps I need to take to properly resod (reseed, actually) the lawn:
Remove all old turf.
Test the composition of the soil.
Add soil amendments to correct soil composition.
Add fertilizer and till 6 inches of the soil.
Level soil to a 1-2 degree grade.
Water for 2 weeks to allow weed seeds to germinate.
Remove weeds with Round Up.
Lightly rake top of soil.
Spread seed equally in two passes, the second at 90 degrees to the first.
Lightly rake the fresh seed.
Lightly roll the fresh seed.
Apply a light layer of mulch.
Water lightly (5-10 minutes) twice daily until lawn height is \BD inch.
Water deeper (15-20 minutes) once daily until lawn height is 3 inches.
Mow lawn to 2 inches with a sharp-bladed bagging mower.

As much as I hate using this page as a place to rant, sometimes it has to be done.  The first assignment for my senior design project is due this Wednesday.  Basically, it is a presentation that explains the requirements of the project.  In order to do the presentation, we need to have a good idea of what the project will be.  Since our project was pretty open-ended, that required meeting with the client (in this case, the biomedical engineering professor).  Professors are busy people, and thus he could not meet with us until today.  He found an opening in his schedule and emailed us at 11:15 AM saying he was free from noon until 2 PM.  None of my other group members could make it, which is understandable given the short notice.  Thus, I had to meet with the professor by myself, while still extremely sick.  Luckily, I was able to be partially coherent and not spray snot all over his office walls.  Since I am poor and car-less, I took the bus from north campus back to central campus after the meeting.  There was one kid standing up in front of my seat while myself and the kid next to me were trying to get off the bus.  I let the kid next to me get up first, then I started to stand up.  When the first kid got up, the guy that was standing slid back and was directly in front of me.  Without even looking above me, I stood up.  I stood up directly into the guys elbow.  Crack, right on top of my head.  Now my leg and my head hurts.
On top of still being very very  urlLink sick , I was woken up this morning at 5:45 AM with the most excruciating charley horse in my right leg.  It probably only lasted 15 seconds, but it felt more like a minute.  Here we are, seven hours later, and my leg is still in pain.  I need to reboot my body.
urlLink Trojaned OpenBSD CDs .  Making your own ISO of OpenBSD is a trivial exercise.  Hell, I make an i386 specific ISO every time a new version of OpenBSD comes out.  You can still get the latest one  urlLink here .  People buy the CD to support the project, and that's it.  No one that has the technical knowledge to need/want/use OpenBSD would be unable to make their own CD.  To all the people that bought this trojaned CD, installed it and got 0wn3d, you deserved it.
urlLink TCP/IP Sequence Number Analysis .  Instead of simply stating that Mac OS 9 has a very predictable TCP/IP sequence, there are graphs that show the spread of such "random" numbers.  Very enlightening.
A sinus infection has left me completely incapacitated.  I had to skip class yesterday, and I may do the same today.  I woke up this morning feeling like I had the worst hangover of my life.  My stomach hurt, my head was throbbing and my muscles were sore.  Yesterday, my nose was leaking like a burst water main.  It was quite odd, minding my own business, playing on the computer, then feeling a hot river of snot pour from my nose with undying fury.  The taste, that was what got to me the most.  Today, my combination of ibuprofen, asprin, claritin, generic over-the-counter decongestant and antihistamine and mulit-vitamins might keep this sickness in check
I finally got my MDE project:   We run some large image processing tasks that run over many processors.  We've developed our own code to distribute computations over several Unix systems, but it's really out of date.  In particular, we need to take advantage of the compute power in Linux clusters.  We have our own small cluster and we would liek to exploit the capabilities of the large cluster in the Center for Parallel Computing.  One of my students provided the following request.  I think this would make a great senior design project with real applicability in the commercial world....   How about a tool set for running background C code or MatLab jobs.  Kind of like the launch program, but for use on our local Athlons.  A script would detect what machines are idle and launch jobs in a joblist serially.  Alternatively, and even better, they could get an account at the Center for Parallel Computing for the Athlon clusters.  These clusters use SMP parallel computing additions to the C language.  For independent C processes like our tracking, it would not be that hard to write scripts that modify the C code so it can run on these Athlon clusters, and maybe even automatically launch it and give feedback in the process.  So users can run independent C code on these systems without having to learn the SMP additions or details about the parallel cluster.  Automatic transfer of files without interactive authentication and big/little endian compensation may pose some challenges.  This is a seriously under-developed project description.  We are going to have a meeting with the professor that suggested this project to get some solid details.  The cool part about this professor is that he works in the biomedical engineering department.  My bio degree will make it easier to get in his head.
I have another project to add to my list.  Hopefully I will finish one of these this semester.  For the sake of argument, I will define the "lifespan" of an operating system to be from the day it is released to the public (either for purchase or for download) to the time *two* new versions of the operating system have come out.  An example would be  urlLink OpenBSD 2.9 .  It was released on June 1st of 2001.  Since  urlLink OpenBSD 3.1  (the second version past 2.9) came out on May 19th of 2002, the lifespan of OpenBSD 2.9 was 06/01/2001 to 05/19/2002.  Over the lifespan of OpenBSD 2.9, there were 27 different patches.  That might not seem like much, but that is over two patches a month.  For a company that has many servers, that could be a lot of patching.  Likewise, the current version of OpenBSD (3.1) has 14 patches already.  That version had only been available for under three months when the last patch was issued.  Now that I have that cleared up, time for the actual project:  An OpenBSD version of  urlLink Windows Update .  Since no self-respecting BSD admin would go to a website for their patches, BSDUpdate would be a command-line tool.  It would check the current state of your system, verify which patches were needed, and download them.  The tool can then install the patches and restart services as/if necessary.  The tool could also be put in "automatic mode" and placed into a cron job for completely seamless updating.  This is actually a very easy project (but also time consuming).  Nevertheless, I will be damned if I ever finish it.
School started this week, which is the main reason why my post frequency has dropped to near-zero.  My classes for this term include Operating Systems, Molecular Biology and the Major Design Experience.    Operating Systems is not as cool as I thought it would be.  Instead of getting an overview of the 1.9 million topics involved with operating systems, we are only learning threads and file systems.  So disappointing.  Molecular has been good so far, which is surprising.  By now, I thought I would be horrifically sick of anything biology related.  I talked to someone new in class for the first time in practically three years, so that might help.  And finally, the Major Design Experience (MDE):  8 credits for a single project.  We were given something like 30 projects to choose from.  We got to pick our top three, then the professors will put us into groups.  My choices were:  Writing a set of UNIX/Linux tools to ease administration of a network that includes UNIX, Linux, Windows and Mac workstations.  Add an extension to the university LDAP server so that email groups can have their list archived or sent as a digest version.  Rebuild the EECS website, both the design and the database backend.  I don't care which one I get, they should all be fairly easy.  Time consuming, but easy.  Once I get into the swing of things, I am sure I will be back to posting (almost) everyday.  I don't even have a desk in my room yet, so it might be awhile.
When people thing of Mac accessories, they think fruity colors and translucency.  Not any more, meet  urlLink Hubzilla .
*Still*  urlLink sick !
You know you are a software engineering geek when:    An every day problem comes along, and instead of just trying to solve it immediately, you have to plan for it.  "Well, we first have to figure out what the real problem is before we can solve it."  Then you have a requirements phase, trying to figure out what will need to be done to solve the problem.  Then you have a design phase, trying to come up with a good way to solve the problem.  Then you actually do it.  I need to spend more time with biology and less with computer science. It's pervasive.
The engineering job fair was this week.  I don't want to say much, but there were three companies that were quite interested in me.  Two are on the West coast and the other is on the East coast.  I don't think I am ready to move just yet.  Real life is pretty scary.
Sprint PCS sucks.  There is a very good reason that the greeting on my phone has been Sprint POS ever since I got it.  Let's go over what happened to me this month:  I moved from Ann Arbor to Livonia back to Ann Arbor.  I changed my address on the Sprint PCS site about a week after I moved to the new Ann Arbor apartment.  The changes just wouldn't stick.  I would change the address, save the changes, reload and the old address would be back.  I tried for about 3 days to get it to stick, no luck.  Eventually, I just couldn't log into the website.  I make all of my payments online, so this was going to be a problem when September 7th rolled around (my billing date).  Obviously, that day blew past.  I couldn't log into the website for a couple weeks and my bill was overdue.  They didn't turn my phone off for a couple weeks, so I thought I was set.  No so much.  They turned it off yesterday.  I STILL can't get into the website.  This morning, I called their customer service number.  I had to PAY $3 to get my address changed over the phone.  That is strike 1.  My new apartment is in the basement of a house.  My cellular reception is extremely spotty and random.  Sprint PCS rarely works in university buildings.  My job, classes and main study area are all in such buildings.  Thus, my cell phone only works when I am walking to and from my destinations.  What cellular provider should I go with?
Ever wanted to print a man page in unix?  You can't simply pipe the output straight to a printer device, it just won't work.  Most normal workstations will have a2ps installed, a tool that converts ascii text to a PostScript file.  To print a man page:  man {someSubject} | a2ps -m -P {printerName}  To save a man page in PS format:  man {someSubject} | a2ps -m -o {fileName}
urlLink Metro VERSUS Festiva  this SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY...
One of the best  urlLink Slashdot  posts I have ever seen, it actually made me laugh out loud:  I can see it now; toe to toe late one night ata stoplight. One man revs his engines, the other responds with a growl of his own. The other prepares his mind for the upcoming duel, the other is hurriedly inputing up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a..... Original  urlLink here .
More important than a new laptop, I got to see Elaine last night!  She moved from Ann Arbor to Philadephia quite awhile ago, so it was great to see her.  She was having dinner with a bunch of her friends from her last job, working at a comic book store.  She was a bit concerned that I wouldn't fit in.  Me, not fit in?  I was just as geeky as the rest of them, it just didn't show as much...  Just kidding, they seemed like a great bunch of people.
I would like to thank  urlLink IBM  for having such a crappy online ordering process that I have decided to buy from a different company.  I would have purchased an  urlLink IBM Thinkpad R , but whenever I would try to pick the parts I wanted, the price would always be "NA".  Maybe that means they are sold out of Thinkpad Rs, but they could have told me in a better fashion.  Because of this set back, I might just buy a laptop from Compaq.  If someone had told me last week that I was going to get a Compaq, I would have laughed my ass off.  Instead, I have fallen in love with the  urlLink Compaq Presario 900 .  As of right now, it is looking like I will be getting these specs:  Mobile Athlon XP 2000+  256 MB 266MHz DDR  30 gig hard drive  8x DVD drive 14.1" XGA Display  Built-in 56k modem and 10/100 NIC  The laptop is a bit beefier than my last one (1.5" thick and 6.8 lbs), but it shouldn't be a noticeable difference.
Mmm mmm consumerism...
Nothing like a 4.5 month hiatus to get the juices flowing.  Expect updates to slowly build up over the weeks until a digital cacophony overwhelms all.
As I  urlLink mentioned previously , I signed up for  urlLink EMusic  recently.  In the first few days, I downloaded upwards of 1.8 GIG of music.  If they are going to offer unlimited downloads, I'm going to take advantage.  I've pulled down 49 albums so far.  Some of the highlights:
Adult.
Apples In Stereo
Belle And Sebastian
Built To Spill
Etta James
Pavement
Sahara Hotnights
The Hives
More will be coming.  Maybe I should keep a list of all my MP3s since that list is growing so incredibly fast.  But anyway, for only $9.95/month (for 12 months) or $14.95/month (for 3 months),  urlLink EMusic  is a great deal if your tastes are broader than mainstream.
When it rains, it pours.  I got an email today from a local Ann Arbor company in the medical field asking if I wanted to interview with them.  The email said nothing about the position so I inquired about that.  We shall see.
Speaking of money, I just got an email saying I have another fly out interview.  I don't want to say who it is with, but they are a computer company in the top 100 of the Fortune 500, in the top 20 of the Best to Work For and in the top 10 of the Most Admired...
Just this morning I told myself that I would stop spending money.  In the past month, I've bought a new digital camera, work out shoes, a bunch of work out clothes, some regular clothes (but no more blue shirts because Leah says I have too many.  Not possible!), and a subscription to  urlLink EMusic .  I spent a lot of money going out, especially on food.  So, I said no more.  Then, I got a gift certificate in the mail for $15 at Express Men.  Jamie and I went today and I said I was only going to spend enough to use up the gift cert.  Not so much.  I ended up spending $80 there and then $40 at Fields buying some new cologne (Pleasures for Men).  I promise, no more.
Hmm, speaking of working out, I never explained how accident-prone I've been over the past few weeks.  I cut myself twice, once on a bagel when I was in a  hurry and once when chopping up peppers and I wasn't paying attention.  The pepper cut, which is on my left thumb, was so deep that I probably needed stitches.  I'm a dumb boy, so I just put a butterfly bandage on to seal it up.  When working out at the beginning of spring break last week, I was walking on my hands (a relic from my pre-wrestling work outs) and stretched out my ACL in my right knee when I landed.  Being a dumb boy, I played racquetball with Joe later that evening.  I was attempting a spinning return when I realized there was no way I could land and put that much pressure on my right knee.  I stopped midway but my racquet kept going.  I smashed myself in the left eye.  I should have taken pictures right when it happened, but here are a couple pictures from over a week after it happened:   Normal coloration   Photoshopped coloration to show bruise beneath the eye
My two hour American Values discussion just got cancelled, woohoo!  I get to work out instead.  Sitting in an overly-warm classroom discussing the people's reaction to the FDR fireside chats or lifting and getting a huge endorphin rush, you make the call.
Texas toast does not taste like ass.  Here is a quick recipe for cheesy bread I just whipped up:

Dannon Light n' Fit Creamy yogurt tastes like ass.  Avoid it much like the polar bear avoids the Miami sun.
Crazy dream #2:  Just a few days ago I had a dream that involved moving down to Georgia.  Since I don't know anyone down there, I had to find housing by myself.  All of the apartments were full or something so I ended up subletting a room in a mansion.  The details of the mansion itself were fuzzy but there definitely was a pond in the back with some odd stones surrounding the perimeter.  (It reminded me of a  urlLink Mandelbrot set , now that I think of it.  Do you dream in fractals?  Thought not.)  The owner of the mansion and (what could only be) his young daughter showed me to a room.  They said there was only one problem, the bed had been in the pond earlier.  Eh, whatever, I took the room anyway.
I fell asleep (in the dream) and woke up with two leech-like beings on my left hand.  I immediately started to swat at them, trying to get them off.  The owner and daughter (who must have been watching me sleep) yelled at me to stop and that these leeches would keep sucking until either they filled with blood or died.  On closer inspection, the leeches had these coiled bodies that could expand and hold a LOT of blood.  I had to get to the hospital, so I called Eric (who knows why he was in Georgia).  He picked me up in some weird Dodge Neon-SUV hybrid (which can be explained by the fact that I fell asleep reading Motor Trend) and we tried to ask for directions to the nearest hospital.  Everyone would give us directions, but different directions.  Just as we got on the highway, I woke up.  My entire left arm was completely asleep which explains the leech bit.
Crazy dream #1:  Just after Leah and I started dating, I had a dream that I was MCing a talent show.  It was held in downtown Detroit in a dingy, 70's-styled theater.  I don't remember how it happened, but I ended up on stage and was told to MC the entire affair.  I didn't know who was supposed to be in the show so I just talked to the crowd and made a game out of it.  Rob Shereda was in the audience and I was under the impression that he was supposed to be the MC but decided to let me run it.  After introducing the first act, I hopped down from the stage into the crowd.  Everyone seemed to be dressed as if it was the 70's, but in that updated-yet-still-retro style.  Leah was there and just as I was about to talk to her, I woke up.
I have a new  urlLink digital camera .  I haven't gotten many chances to use it, but it was put into full effect to capture a  urlLink typical night out .  Check out the rest of the galleries  urlLink here .  Hopefully that will quickly fill up with galleries from my tenth and final semester here.  Last week was spring break and mostly it was spent at work.  For those of you that haven't been dragged into the Daily by now, here is a  urlLink quick run down of the important areas .  The  urlLink really big   urlLink black server  in that gallery is the old database server that I replaced last weekend.  Other than work, I hung out with Leah as much as possible.  We went up to State for a night and that would have been a prime candidate for picture taking, but I hadn't met 90% of those people yet.  It's just better to not be "that guy that always has his camera" just yet.
Here is some background as to what has been going on in my life the past 5 months.  First, I am seeing someone new.  Her name is Leah and to try to explain how perfectly the relationship is developing would be to spoil it.  Expect to hear more about that later.  Second, and related to the first, I'm no longer with Laura.  Things were a bit rough at the end of last semester and she decided to end it.  No hard feelings, on my part.  Third, I will be graduating come April 25th.  Fourth, I have no idea where I will be after said graduation.  There is a job possibility down in Alpharetta, Georgia, but I won't be saying any more about that until I know for sure.
Crazy euchre story:  Leah (on the other team) was dealing and turned up a bower.  I was three-suited and called it up with NO TRUMP.  We won that hand and won the game 10-0.  Am I lucky or what?

Homework can wait.  Tonight was the  urlLink Sarah Slean  concert!  While I was checking out  urlLink other concerts , I saw that she would be playing at  urlLink The Ark  tonight.  I knew that Jenn was a fan, so we decided to go.  I had only heard a couple of her songs quite a while ago, but I figured it would be good to go to a concert anyway.  I'm damn glad I went.  Not only was it a good time with Jenn (and seeing Beth wasn't half bad), but the concert itself was so good it was inspiring.    I really had no idea what to expect.  When a gorgeous redhead (though fake, I think) took the stage with a vivacious and humorous stage presence, I knew this was going to be good.  She has a good command over the piano, ranging from full-yet-harsh wailing to soft and melodic.  Her voice takes a bit of getting used to, but she has some power when she wants to use it.  Her lyrics were a bit obtuse for a first time listener, but that will surely correct itself over time.  Interestingly enough, her guitarist was actually the most talented person on stage.  He played four different instruments total, two electrics, one acoustic and one that could only be described as an electric tweleve-string ukulele.  With the help of at least 12 different pedals, he added a depth to the music that would have left the piano naked without.  All in all, a pretty kick ass show.  Jenn bought her newest CD and quickly sent me MP3s of all the songs when she got home.  This is definitely going into my permanent rotation.
I hate that  urlLink fweakin' marshmallow .
Another good workout followed by consuming way too much damned food.  The last time I did this I ate a bowl of tomato rice soup, a ham and swiss on sourdough, a granola bar, a yogurt and two oranges.  Today was another bowl of tomato rice soup, a veggie burger,  urlLink three pieces of cheesy bread , two huge oranges and a bag of pretzels.  For lunch!  I am glad that my goal of working out is better physical fitness and health, not overall weight loss...
Haven't heard much from/about  urlLink these guys  lately.  Here is an  urlLink image gallery  from their latest tour in Japan.
Sigh, so many concerts I want to see.  Either there is no one to go with, or I can't get a ride, or they are just too pricey.  Here is the short list:
Sparta (March 15th @ State Theater)
Rocket From The Crypt (March 17th @ Magic Stick)
Kodo (March 24th @ Michigan Theater)
Sahara Hotnights (March 31st @ The Shelter)
Adult. (April 4th @ Institute of Art)
The White Stripes (April 15th @ Masonic Temple)
The White Stripes (April 16th @ Masonic Temple)
Adult. (May 17th @ Magic Stick)
Current Reading: The Feminine Mystique, by Betty Friedan.  I've just barely started reading and I'm already hooked.  She describes the plight of the 1950s/1960s housewife so spot on and with such clarity, it borders on prescience.
A quagmire of concrete, brick and sod, that is all a suburban home seems to me now.  I need to live in a big city, at least until I have kids.
Jamie, Alissa and I just tried  urlLink Potbelly  for the first time.  Not bad!  The sandwiches are tasty and hot and cheap ($3.79).  Alissa tried the ice cream and that got a thumbs up, Jamie and I tried the cookies and they got a thumbs up.  Big thumbs down on their fountain pop though.  The cup was probably only 12 ounces yet it cost $1.39!  For $1.39, you get a 32 ounce cup at Jimmy John's.  I guess they have to make up costs somewhere.
Newest albums added to my collection:
Drive Like Jehu - Yank Crime

This has been a crazy week.  The craziest part is trying to organize one of my interviews.  When they initially contacted me a couple of weeks ago, they asked for 8 possible interview dates.  I gave them 8 and then realized a few days later that one of those dates was the same as my AI final!  Murphy's Law in full effect, they chose that day.  I emailed my contact back immediately and asked if it could be rescheduled to any of the other days.  The best she could do was to push it back a day, to April 25th.  I have finals on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th and then commencement is on the 26th.  Bad timing, eh?  So, here is a rough estimation of my schedule for those three days:
April 24th
10:30 AM - 12:30 PM: Final
Between 3 PM and 6 PM: Fly out of DTW
Between 6 PM and 9 PM: Arrive
Afterward: Crash at hotel
April 25th
6 AM: Wake up, get ready, find office
8:30 AM: Interview, interview, interview
Between 9 PM and Midnight: Fly out
April 26th
Between 5 AM and 8 AM: Arrive at DTW
9:15 AM: Commencement
I can't believe I am taking the redeye from an interview to catch commencement.
urlLink The Gulf War Two Drinking Game .
Current Music:  "Bombs Over Baghdad" by Outkast
I've fallen in love with two older games lately:   urlLink Gran Turismo 3  and  urlLink chess .  Yeah, chess is just a wee bit older.
Basically, Joe tossed GT3 into the PS2 earlier this week for the first time since we've owned it.  He has only played the rally races (since he hates all of the races on pavement).  Matt and him scrapped for awhile and I tossed my hat into the ring.  I was under the impression that to correctly navigate a turn you had to be turning the whole time.  In rally, this couldn't be farther from the truth.  You turn well before the actual bend in the road and then power slide through almost every one.  I got smoked in those first few races.  After they had left, I gave the course a few more runs.  I just barely beat the course on "Easy" mode *then* I figured out turning.  Each run saw my times improving after each iteration.  Eventually, I was beating the CPU car by 10 seconds in "Hard" mode.  That is when I got hooked.
GT3 is an extremely deep game.  Even the simplistic "Arcade" mode has 30+ tracks and too many cars for me to count.  The simulation mode has a depth I haven't quite fathomed yet.  You start off with a meager amount of money and no cars.  My first car had a whopping 116 HP to start, which was pretty depressing since Zig had a car that was pushing 1048 HP.  You can customize your car, earn driving licenses (that allow you to enter the more difficult races), and obviously race.  I've just started, but I'm sure I am going to be hooked.
On to chess.  For some reason, Zig decided that all of his programming buddies should have a contest.  He will write a basic GUI that allows people to plug-in two chess engines and have them go at it.  I doubt I will participate (since writing a chess engine would take hundreds of hours, at least), but that got chess on our minds.  After dinner (a Tuesday night tradition with the guys), Chris and I ran to the chess store at Briarwood and picked up a chess clock.  We went back to my apartment and played four games:  Chris versus Matt, Matt versus Joe, Joe versus myself and then Joe versus Chris.  None of the games ended with a checkmate since we were playing with the clock.  The first game gave 15 minutes per person then we pulled that down to 10 minutes per game when Joe was playing.  I just didn't pay attention to the clock and I ran out of time with the game probably only half way through.  Speed chess just isn't my thing, but I at least didn't lose in less than 20 minutes total.
Hopefully I stick with both of these games.
I *knew* I was using that word incorrectly.  Whenever I feel like I am giving up and letting someone else have their way, I might say something about " urlLink subjugating  my will" to them.  In all reality, I have been meaning to say  urlLink abdicate !  I could say something like "I'm just allowing you to subjugate my will", but that doesn't have the same ring to it.  Say it with me: "abdicate my will", "abdicate my will" and "abdicate my will".
Google supports wild card searching!  Type in something like  urlLink "give me * or I'll kill you"  and Google will find all results that start with "give me ", end with " or I'll kill you" and have a single word in the '*' location.  Sweet.
Jamie, Joe and I hung out yesterday.  We just absolutely had to enjoy the weather!  The diag wasn't the most verdant place (the snow washes away yet everything is so dirty) but it was enjoyable nonetheless.  We grabbed Jimmy John's on the way then sat by the flagpole.  We mainly talked about the  urlLink night before  and how we wished it turned out just a little bit less dramatic.  As always, we also discussed the future.  I finally realized that Joe is going to be moving out of state no matter what happens.  We didn't know each other too well until this year, but I feel we've gotten close.  I'll miss him.
Jamie and I discussed how cool it would be if we both do end up staying in the Ann Arbor area.  I now have an official job offer from a company around here, so it just might happen.  Of course I am still going to have my fly-out interviews.  We shall see.  My camera got some more use; check out the pictures from the day  urlLink here .
Over the years, a few people I have known personally have started weblogs.  Those are always the best because you know most of the basic information about their life anyway.  The weblog is just another glimpse into their psyche.  Well, just recently, Eric started his own  urlLink weblog .  Another one of my good friends started one as well, but that is NOT for public consumption.
Last night, Joe and I had planned a little gathering.  It was going to start with pizza, then drinking/euchre/video games and then finally going to see the midnight showing of Batman at the State Theater.  Well, the plans quickly changed.  We started off playing spades, chowing down snacks and drinking beer.  Eventually more people showed up so we got pizza, played some GT3 and broke out the hard liquor.  When it was time to leave for the movie, we voted and decided it would be more fun to stick around.
This is when the night started to break down.  Somebody started getting pretty upset when we played Never Have I Ever, then another got upset because of sexual comments and then finally someone got violently ill.  There is still a huge mixing bowl filled with puke and a blanket covered in puke in our bathroom.  Other than that, it was great!  See the pictures  urlLink here .
Just the other day, an ex-girlfriend told me that she got married early last year.  Just tonight, I heard that a friend from work last summer just got engaged.  I'm a little freaked out.
Hmm, let's see which is nicer:  ANN ARBOR, MI    ALPHARETTA, GA    REDMOND, WA
Only in Michigan is a 26 degree temperature drop normal!
urlLink Refused  are everything Rage Against the Machine wanted to be.
Deadly Sins
ANGER
1.  Who did you last get angry with?   I guess I would have to say Chris Payne.  He was acting very out of character last Saturday night.
2.  What is your weapon of choice?   First choice is words, second choice is the fist.
3.  Would you hit a member of the opposite sex?   Under 99.99% of circumstances, never.  The only reason I would ever hit a female would be to protect someone.  In all reality, I would probalby just hold them back if possible.
4.  How about of the same sex?   Of course I would rail on a dude.  Dudes are made to be hit.
5.  Who was the last person who got really angry at you?   Jamie.  Kids say the darndest things.
6.  What is your pet peeve?   When people bite their fork.  It sounds like nails on a chalkboard and it seems so trashy.
7.  Do you keep grudges, or can you let them go easily?   It depends on who it is against.  If it is with someone I am close to, it is usually quickly resolved.  Against someone I do not know well or do not like, it can last indefinitely.
SLOTH
1.  What is one thing you're supposed to do daily that you haven't done in a long time?   Use my teeth whitener.  All those years of drinking nothing but coffee and Diet Coke did a number on them.
2.  What is the latest you've ever woken up?   5 PM.  I once pulled an all nighter and ended up going to bed around noon.
3.  Name a person you've been meaning to contact, but haven't?  Hmm, my maternal grandmother.
4.  What is the last lame excuse you made?   Not really an excuse, but just tonight Megan and I were at Borders.  There was a book called  Why Paint Cats  (yes, it's as weird as it sounds).  She actually bought a book called  Why Cats Paint  for her dad, so I said that this must be a sequel thus she must buy it.
5.  Have you ever watched an infomercial all the way through (one of the long ones...)?    Never.  I don't watch TV, other than  urlLink 24 .
6.  How many times did you hit the snooze button on your alarm clock today?   I didn't.  I don't need an alarm clock anymore.  When I quit drinking caffeine, my sleep requirements went from 8.5 hours a night to just about 5 hours a night.
7.   How many times have you skipped work/classes this month?   Since I have a completely flexible work schedule, I cannot techincally skip work.  I think I've skipped two classes total.
GLUTTONY
1.  What is your overpriced yuppie beverage of choice?   SoBe green tea...   drool...
2.  Meat eaters: white meat or dark meat?   White meat.
3.  What is the greatest amount of alcohol you've had in one sitting/outing/event?   Probably about 14 drinks in a single evening.
4.  What's the most you've ever weighed?  188, the weight I am at now.  Ever since I started working out almost every day, I've gained about 10 pounds.  Hopefully I've actually lost some fat and gained more than 10 pounds in muscle.
5.  What have you eaten so far today?   Breakfast was a bowl of cereal, a bagel and a can of mixed fruit.  Lunch was a veggie sub from Jimmy John's.  Afternoon snack was crackers with peanut butter and jelly.  Dinner was another sub, this time a ham one from Potbelly.  I am sure I will eat the equivalent of another meal before I go to bed.  Working out has dramatically increased my metabolism.
6.  When was the last time you ate so much you felt sick?   The last time I got two subs from Jimmy John's after working out.  My stomach couldn't handle it, but my body was craving nutrients.
7.  When was the last time you got drunk to the point of throwing up?   That time I had 14 drinks in an evening.  Playing poker with the guys and going shot for shot isn't a good call.
LUST
1.  How many people have you seen naked (not counting movies/family)?   3 plus naked mile plus however many people were on the wrestling and football teams in high school
2.  How many people have seen YOU naked (not counting physicians/family)?  3 plus the teams
3.  Have you ever caught yourself staring at the chest/crotch of a member of your gender of choice during a normal conversation?   Yes.
4.  Have you "done it"?    Yes.
5.  What is your favorite body part on a person of your gender of choice?   Eyes.
6.  Have you ever been propositioned by a prostitute?   No.
7.  Have you ever had to get tested for an STD or pregnancy?   No.
GREED
1.  How many credit cards do you own?   I personally have 2 in my name and then there is a card that is a joint account of myself and my aunt and a debit card.
2.  What's your guilty pleasure store?   I guess J. Crew.
3. I f you had $1 million, what would you do with it?   I would move out of my crappy apartment, buy a few  urlLink cars  and try to invest the rest.
4.  Would you rather be rich, or famous?   Rich.  Being famous is pointless.
5.  Would you accept a boring job if it meant you would make megabucks?   Aren't all jobs inherently boring to some degree?
6.  Have you ever stolen anything?    Yes.  I vividly remember taking Vaseline lip balm when I was 6.
7.  How many MP3s are on your hard drive?   Currently, 3,898.
PRIDE
1.  What one thing have you done that you're most proud of?   I am not really proud of anything yet.  I will find pride when I have a happy, stable family.
2.  What one thing have you done that your parents are most proud of?   Anything academic.  They've been proud of me so far in all aspects though.
3.  What thing would you like to accomplish in your life?   Other than the happy, stable family, I would like to make some lasting contribution to whatever field I end up working in.
4.  Do you get annoyed by coming in second place?   Of course!  I am more competitive than almost anyone I know.
5.  Have you ever entered a contest of skill, knowing you were of much higher skill than all the other competitors?   Again, of course.  It's so easy to crush people that way, and crushing makes me feel whole.
6.  Have you ever cheated on something to get a higher score?   Of course.
7.  What did you do today that you're proud of?   I set a new max on my bench press.  I'm only at 250 pounds though.
ENVY
1.  What item (or person) of your friends would you most want to have for your own?   Currently, Zig's car would be nice.  I want something faster though.
2.  Who would you want to go on "Trading Spaces" with?   Kristin Happ, since she is the only person I know that watches that show more than my parents.
3.  If you could be anyone else in the world, who would you be?   No one.
4.  Have you ever been cheated on?   Actually, I don't know.  I may have been cheated on with two different girls, but I have no proof.
5.  Have you ever wished you had a physical feature different from your own?   Yes, I wish my skin was clearer and I was less hairy.
6.  What inborn trait do you see in others that you wish you had for yourself?   Complete confidence.
Today while I was working out at the CCRB, a girl actually hit on me.  This has happened maybe three times in my entire life.  Here are the details:  The wrestling mats were laid out in the martial arts room because a session of aikido had just concluded.  I had just finished my cardio and lifting and was walking around a bit to cool down.  When I saw the mats, I decided to do some of my wrestling rolls just as a cool down.  I started off walking on my hands because that was the most fun and was the most strenuous.  A girl that was stretching at the end of the room started watching me.  I ignored it, since she was just watching because who walks on their hands?  Thirty seconds later, she came up to me and asked if she could join me.  At this point, I was a bit confused.  I hadn't been hit on in a very long time so I didn't know what to do and I also have a very serious girlfriend.  I didn't want to blow this girl off just for the sake of being rude, but I couldn't lead her on in any way.  Anyway, I said of course she could join me and she asked if I did gymnastics.  I explained that I used to walk on my hands when I wrestled in high school.  She asked if I wrestled for Michigan and I just laughed.  We introduced ourselves and she then said that she does hand stands because she used to do gymnastics in school and that now she likes to breakdance.  She started to show off by walking on her hands and then doing single handed dismounts.  At this point, I either had to commit or bail.  Instead of committing by asking about her dancing, I simply said that I had to get going.  She laughed out of obvious nervousness, probably because she didn't want me to leave.  I simply grabbed my water bottle and headphones and ended that encounter.
Leah will be in Miami from now until Sunday.  Sigh.  I should have time to fill in that  urlLink survey  soon.
I will fill in this survey later today.

There are enough MP3s on my computer to listen for over a week straight and never hear the same song twice.  Winamp says 183 hours, 14 minutes and 1 second worth of musical goodness is available.  Since it is all on Kazaa, it is  available .
If you have a second, do a search for my last name in Kazaa.  Over 259 files showed up all because I embedded my name in the ID3 tag of some MP3s I ripped.  These songs were ripped my freshman year of college and then placed on my FTP server.  At the peak, this server got over 100,000 hits in a single weekend.  It's fun to see that my files have spread across the globe.
When I get older and I own a home, I will have a personal library.  I'm not talking about a den that has a large shelf of books.  I'm talking about a room devoted solely to housing books.  If my (or my wife's) affluence accounts for it, the books will all be bound in the same color and style (not necessarily leather).
The waters choppy, but it doesn't cut me, no
'Cause I ain't sinkin', no I ain't goin down below
I don't think that way, you know I never have
Well I cant slow down now just because you lag
You're always pulling, keep on trying to bring me down
I'm going to show you that I don't like to fuck around
You show your face and I'll look the other way
You blink your eyes and you've got no friends to play
Pick up the slack
I won't carry your monkey on my back
Save the world
Got no time, I've got to save myself today
I've got a mission to fulfill the things in life
I've got a lot of things to see before I live to die
All this negativity tries to bring me down
As you get worse, I turn my life around
Death By Stereo - Looking Out For Number One
Just so that everyone knows and that I do not forget,  urlLink Eric  is playing at the  urlLink Blind Pig  on April 1st, 2003.  Also, it's a shame that I already have two sets of plans for this upcoming Friday because Athletic Mic League is going to be at the Pig.
Benadryl =  bad.    I've been taking Claritin for years now, at least since high school.  Just recently, they came out with an over-the-counter form of Claritin.  Now my health insurance doesn't cover perscriptions to Claritin and the OTC version costs $13 for ten doses!  When my prescription to Claritin had run out at school and I needed something to tide me over until I made it to the doctor next, I would just get an off-brand  urlLink antihistamine/decongestant .    When I went to the store to pick some up, they were all out so I decided to try the  urlLink Benadryl version .  Not at good call at all!  Some people take Benadryl just as a sleep aid and now I know why.  I took two in the past few days and my sleep needs have gone up at least 25%.  I even fell asleep in the car when Leah's mom was driving us back to Ann Arbor!  I had to take a nap from noon until 2 PM today even though I got more than my normal amount of sleep last night.  Does anyone need a sleep aid?  I'm not taking anymore of these.
I am definitely not a big fan of Star Trek, but I've been known to watch quite a bit of The Next Generation and some Deep Space Nine.  Slashdot had an  urlLink article  about Enterprise and how Rick Berman is going to try to salvage it.  The discussion about this article ranged from how Berman needs to be executed to reasoning why the first series were much better.  Out of the blue comes  urlLink this comment .  It is an idea for a new Star Trek show.  The basic premise is of a cadre of special ops members of the Federation that take care of the dirty work.  Read the comment.  If it was shot in a dark, plodding, almost psycho manner, it could be a hit.  If it turns into another wild cowboy show, it could fail.
If the visitors of  urlLink Kempa.com  made up a list of best albums of all time, the concensus for the top spots would be:
Radiohead - OK Computer : (9 votes)
Weezer - Pinkerton : (7 votes)
Beach Boys - Pet Sounds : (4 votes)
Minutemen - Double Nickels On The Dime : (3 votes)
Pavement - Slanted and Enchanted : (3 votes)
Beatles - Abbey Road : (3 votes)
Sloan - Twice Removed : (3 votes)
Sadly, I do not have two of these albums (Abbey Road and Double Nickels On The Dime).  I should fix that soon.
Ok, now I have a bit of time to talk about my weekend.  Thursday, I ended up going out with Jamie and Chris.  I really think we have coalesced and get along great as a threesome now.  That is depressing because Chris officially moves to Chicago on Wednesday.  But anyway, we had a good time.  We ended up going to Scorekeepers because of the enticement of $3 pitchers of Coors Light.  We were surprised to find out that before 10 PM, there were $1.50 pitchers of both Coors and Killian's.  Needless to say, we finished off four of them between 9 PM and 10 PM.  Since it was a Thursday, the place was packed like Chinese in the SARS treatment office.  I saw at least four people that I knew, possibly more.
Friday was the  urlLink Compulsive Lyres  concert.  I hadn't been to an a cappella concert in quite some time, even though I went often in my first few years here.  The Lyres put on a great performance, as did the  urlLink Friars  and the  urlLink Maine Steiners .  Not so great was the Indigo dance team.  After being introduced, they were late getting on stage, couldn't find their places, had to reorganized everything on stage and then the music problems kicked in.  First, there was a boom box on stage that was used as a prop by the Lyres.  For some reason, the dance team thought their music was going to be played on said boom box.  First they couldn't figure out how to turn it on, then they noticed that there was no CD in it.  They looked around confused, got into their dance positions just as their music started  blaring  over the auditorium speakers.  This was just the beginnings of their problems.  Two of the girls just could not stay in sync which threw everyone off.  Though there were many little kids in the audience, most of their music was about sex and filled with swearing.  Needless to say, even though they were scheduled to dance during two portions of the show, they didn't return.  After the show was the Lyres after party at Colonial lanes.  It was a Rock 'N Bowl night, which actually turned out to be quite fun.  Jamie, Alissa, Bri and I bowled a couple of games and none of us broke 100.  Somehow, Jamie found a way to bowl that required her to clench her left butt cheek for balance.  Her butt was sore for days afterward.  We all had fun while bowling, but things got a bit tense early in the morning.  Saturday, Chris and I hung out for most of the day.  His back is pretty messed up, so we went to the doctors first.  The rest of the day was spent playing video games (Tekken 4 and NWN).  That night, Jamie, Zig, Eric, Matt, Kristin and I went to Charlie's and then back to Jamie's place.  Things got a bit crazy at Jamie's since I ended up putting Crisco in Zig's mouth at one point.  I thought it was maybe 1 AM when I finally went to bed but Jamie informed me later that it was closer to 5 AM.  Whoops.  Anyway,  urlLink here  are the pictures from that night.

Looks like I am going to buy a 350Z!
I don't have much time to tell you all the details about last night, but here is the  urlLink image gallery .
Leave it to Ann Arbor to be one of the  urlLink most overpriced places to live !
I'm back from my first interview trip!  Here are the  urlLink pictures .  Funny picture from the car rental place,  urlLink 404: Car Not Found .  It's a shame that someone already has  urlLink my   urlLink car  at the company I interviewed with.
I will try to post a bit more before I go on the first of my interview trips, but I at least needed to point out the  urlLink pictures from Mat's surprise party .  There are actual  urlLink pictures   urlLink of   urlLink Leah !
Bwahahaha, the  urlLink Wings got swept in the first round ?  It just seems so comical!  Even with a cast of (current, past, future) All-Stars like Yzerman, Federov, Shanahan, Robitaille, Hull, Lidstrom, Chelios and Joseph, we got swept in the first round.  It doesn't matter how good you think the Ducks are, the fact is that we were swept.  None of the games were blowouts, but even that fact is inconsequential.    Since we can't rely on the Lions or the Tigers for championships, I guess it's up to the  urlLink Pistons  now!
Don't worry, I won't be moving to Georgia anytime soon.
Today is the final day of classes for my undergraduate career.
I have a 8-10 page research paper due in 30 hours.  As of now, I have one paragraph.  Yay, procrastination!
Sorry for the lack of posts lately, the end of the semester is hitting hard.  Yesterday, the weather was gorgeous, so Leah and I took a walk through the Arb.  Afterwards I made dinner and subsequently felt extremely tired.  She ran off to a few group meetings and it was time for me to study for the rest of the night.  The combination of the weather, working out, taking a walk and a full meal wore me out, so I decided to make some coffee.  I haven't had large amounts of caffeine since I gave it up at the beginning of this year.  I drank half a pot in about an hour and a half.
Let's just say that was a horrible idea.  I started to get pretty wired an hour in, but I figured that would be the only symptom.  I was so wrong.  My concentration started to wane, I was getting dizzy and then it got worse.  Eventually, I just wanted to either run around the room or puke.  I had to dry heave for a good five minutes until I could stand up again.  I got probably a good half an hour of work done between midnight and 3:30 AM when I finally fell asleep.
88 degrees today and 39 degrees in only two days?!  I really ought to move out of Michigan.
I do realize that I will be graduating in three days, but I keep forgetting all of the little details that this entails.  Last week, I had my final class and final blue book exam.  This week, I wrote my final paper.  Tomorrow will be my final exam.  This is slightly overwhelming!
A lot of things are going to be different when I graduate.  There are many little advantages I take for granted, like student pricing on tickets and all of the computing access I get from the university.  I need to figure out what I'm going to do for a primary email address!  I will probably move over to something like mike@bibik.org soon.  But where should I host it?  I don't want to pay for hosting, I am leaving the Daily soon so I can't use their servers and my home server doesn't have a static IP.  Oh well, that might be the least of my worries.
More later, but for now, it's time for my second-to-last final!
I dreamed that I finally bought the  urlLink Z .  How utterly pathetic is that?  Dreams are a vessel of idyllic imagery or gut-wrenching iconography, not a venue for a materialistic wank.
Once again, I'm using this site to store infomation I would otherwise forget.  In a Slashdot article about air filtration, someone  urlLink posted a very inexpensive way to filter a whole room .  Just attach some polyester air filter material (the poster suggested 1" thick Blue Tint) to a large box fan.  Seems simple enough, especially in a room with a generous amount of ambient noise (read: a server room, or my room since it has two loud computers and a fan already).
I  urlLink graduated .  More later.
Let's see, where to begin...  First, the interview from a week and a half ago!  I can't divulge much information, for two reasons:  1)  I haven't gotten a yes or a no from said company.  2)  I had to sign an NDA before I could talk to anyone.  Let's see how many details I can give away without giving it all away.
First, I was told that I would have anywhere between three and five interviews total.  There ended up being a total of six, which I can only interpret as being a hopeful sign.  I arrived at the recruiting building (yes, an entire building devoted to recruiting) around 8 AM and didn't end up leaving until around 6 PM.  Given a half hour for lunch, that was practically nine and a half hours of interviewing!
Second, the riddles asked were fairly interesting and though I might have heard them all before, I had never solved any of them.  The first one wasn't so much a riddle as a generic design question.  I was asked how I would design the timing on any given traffic light.  I was allowed to request whatever information desired and then I had to come up with some formulas for making the "best" traffic light.  The first part of the problem was how to define "best".  What makes a good traffic light?  I decided it was a combination of two factors:  1)  Maximum throughput in all directions.  2)  Low traffic jam incidence rate.  After figuring out the formula for a single intersection, I had to modify it for a grid of intersections.  Then I was asked to "think outside the box" (yes, that phrase was used exactly) and figure out other ways to improve the experience.  All in all, a basic design problem.
The second riddle was a programming question, something I didn't expect to encounter since I was interviewing for a management position.  Managers don't code!  I was given a 2D array and had to figure out the time it would take to sort it.  I barely remembered performance numbers for the different sort algorithms, but I remembered that quick sort was O(n log n) (and thankfully was correct).  Sorting a 2D array would thus take (O(n log n))^2.  The second part to the programming question was how to sort two already sorted linked lists.  This was simple, since you just setup two iterators that would move along the two lists, removing the smaller of the two items.
The riddle I had the hardest time with was the cube desk calendar.  You have two cubes and you are allowed to put any single digit on any face.  With these two cubes, you have to represent every number from 01 to 31.  This turned out to not be that difficult when I realized you could mathematically approach this and define restrictions.  Some examples of these restrictions are that you need a "1" on each block since you have to represent "11".  The same thing for "2" and "22".  Eventually, I got to the point where I had six open spots on the cubes but seven numbers to put on the cubes.  This is when I realized that you could use "6" to represent a "9" and thus solved the puzzle.
Almost all of the riddle had a mathematic basis.  The next riddle started off as a word problem.  A man starts at point A on a mountain and walks up to point B in exactly 12 hours.  At some time later, he walks down from point B to point A in exactly 12 hours.  He does not have a constant rate of ascent or descent.  The actual riddle was "Can you prove or disprove the existence of a point P where the man took the same amount of time to reach the same spot on the mountain?"  I was having trouble trying to prove this, since it had to be true.  Eventually, I was given a hint to use a graph.  First I tried plotting time versus distance.  That was dumb.  Once I plotted time versus location, I showed that the plots must intersect and thus a point P does exist.
The last riddle was one I heard a long, long time ago.  I knew the answer, but didn't know how to explain it at first.  This was the "Let's Make a Deal" riddle:  You have three doors to choose from, 1 with a prize and 2 without.  After you choose your door, the host of the show will eliminate one of the doors you did not choose and then ask you to pick again.  You can either stick with your original door or choose the remaining door.  The question is, do you stay or do you switch and why?  I knew you were supposed to switch, but couldn't think off the top of my head why.  Finally I realized that your initial chance at winning was only 1 in 3.  After the elimination, your chance is at least 2 in 3.  Switching is smart.
Ok, that was the first of more updates.  I gotta run now though.
Ok, everyone has been bugging the hell out of me to post, so here comes a barrage of updates.

Well, it's official.  I've been waiting a long time to post anything of substance because I knew a decision would be coming soon.  I'm now officially a Program Manager at Microsoft on the Critical Response Team in the Mobile Devices Division.
I will probably be moving out there between the end of June and mid-July.  I'm not sure yet.  There is so much I want to accomplish before moving, so many people to see and say goodbye to, it's overwhelming.  Today, I went car shopping.  I think I found the one I want, but it's a bit pricy for someone who won't be seeing that first pay check for at least two months.  I could wait, but I want it now!  ::whine::

Well, I chickened out.  I didn't buy  urlLink this , I bought  urlLink this  instead.  Instead of leasing a car for three years, I'm buying it over three years.  I'm also saving myself hundreds of dollars a month in payments and insurance.  I guess I'm happy with this responsible decision.
Mmm mmm, nothing like a good one month hiatus to get the not-so-creative juices flowing.  Where to start...
Well, obviously, I started working at Microsoft!  The move out was emotional, if not uneventful.  The flight went fine, I got my month-long rental car just fine and I got into my new (temporary) apartment just fine.  Jenn so gratiously gave me a Gamecube just before I left.  That worked out perfectly because all of my stuff had already been packed to be shipped to the Seattle area so I had to take the GC on the plane.  If it wasn't for the TV and the GC, I probably would have died of boredom those first four days.  Imagine being in apartment without 99% of your belongings in a new city where you don't know anyone.  It was worse than I can describe.  Yeah, I cried off and on those first few days.  There are so many people back in the SE-MI area that I miss!
Once I got through those first few days, life improved.  I got into a routine of waking up early and going to bed early to prepare myself for work.  I drove around town getting myself used to the area.  One big thing I've noticed is the marked difference in driving patterns.  Five over the speed limit is the most I've seen someone without a radar detector do.  Most people drive slower than the speed limit!  This could be because everyone is used to the traffic...   I swear to god it has to be some of the worst in the US.  The area is surrounded by water and mountains so the highways are not as plentiful as possible.  It's also difficult to widen any of the existing highways.  There are simply too many people and cars for the area.  They do have HOV (carpool) lanes, but it seems that very few people can take advantage of them.  I think I might start carpooling just because no one else is.  Some of the on-ramps are metered (meaning that there is a light that will allow only one car through every few seconds) but allow open access to the HOV lane.  I've also decided to change my car choice because of the traffic.  What's the fun in a  urlLink sports car  if you can't take advantage of it?  It's also possible that I will have a substantial commute, so gas mileage might be a big concern.  I also haven't chosen a city to live in, let alone an apartment.  Lots to do in the next couple of weeks!
As for the job itself, I'm really not sure how much I can say.  I have a much better understanding of what I will actually be doing though!  From what I can tell, I will be a bug wrangler.  Basically, I will help the developers and testers eliminate bugs from already-released products.  Hotfix, updates, service packs, stuff like that.  Also, my title has changed in the past two weeks: Program Manager on the Critical Response Team in the Mobile Devices Product Group.  They changed from MDD (Mobile Devices Division) to MDPG (Mobile Devices Product Group).  I was told this is a common occurance and not to stock up on business cards since they will be out of date before I get them.  I can't tell anyone my phone number or office number since they are supposed to change in the next two weeks.  The entire group (MDPG) is being shuffled around to better coordinate the smaller groups (like CRT).
If there is one thing I don't like about the job (yeah, already!) is that there are no set hours.  Basically, if you are in the office in time for meetings and you get all of your work done, you can work whatever hours you want.  Because of this, everyone has the mentality that they need to work 12 hours a day to look productive!  The first day (Monday), I simply told my boss that I was leaving when I had finished all of my day-one work.  He said that was okay.  Today (the second day), I ended up staying for 11 hours.  I got in around 7:30 AM, which is about 2.5 hours before most of the office gets in.  When 4:30 PM rolled around, I didn't think it would look right to leave.  The office was still packed!  I need to go to a car dealership tomorrow around 5 PM and the dealership is 30 minutes away.  I'm going to have to leave before 4:30 PM.  I don't care what it looks like, I'm working hard.  I was given a simple to-do list for the next two days and I've already finished it.  I'm doing well, so far!
Anyway, that is all I have time for right now.  I still don't have my company-issued laptop and my two computers from home haven't shipped yet, so I have resorted to checking my Umich mail from the local library.  Hopefully this all gets rectified soon.  I miss you all!

A lot of you know that Joe and I never returned bottles when we were living together in Ann Arbor.  What few of you know is just how MANY bottles we acquired over the 9 months that we lived there.  We filled an entire closet: 708 bottles total!  Not bad, eh?
Added pictures from the  urlLink Fourth of July .  I guess I really should add some content other than just pictures...  On the Fourth,  urlLink Lee ,  urlLink Ben ,  urlLink Russ  and I went over to  urlLink Mark's  place for a BBQ.  A few other people stopped by, friends of Mark and Lee's from Umich.  We started cooking the meat before we realized that we didn't have any BBQ tools.  A few of us ran to the store and picked up a set, but that was after we had already melted a plastic spatula trying to remove some hamburgers.
We cooked and chatted for a few hours, then decided to go to downtown Seattle for fireworks.  Russ and I took his car and Ben and Lee took Lee's car.  Let's just say that it was a case of the blind leading the blind.  Once we found where we were supposed to be, the traffic was unbareable.  It took us at least an hour to find parking, then another 30 minutes to walk to the park.  We met up with some other people just in time for some snacks and then the fireworks started!  The show wasn't terribly eventful; the Livonia fireworks were almost as good.  Afterward, most of the group was going to bars down in Pioneer Square.  Our group dwindled down to Lee, Ben, myself and a guy named Matt.  Neither Matt nor Ben wanted to go to the bar and Lee and myself are fairly laid back, so we succumbed to their will.  Instead of the bars, we went to 7-11 for slurpees then to Krispy Kreme for 18 donuts.  Pretty lame, but it was actually pretty fun.
That's a bit more than a typical night with the guys, but we are hanging out quite often.  They are a fun bunch, and this is really helping me adjust to the Seattle area.  I will never forget the people back in the Ann Arbor - Livonia area yet I'm glad I've met some people out here.

Ever need to change your MAC address for AT&T Broadband / Comcast in the Seattle area?  Just set your web proxy to be sas.r1.attbi.com, port 8000 and make sure that you have *.r1.attbi.com set as a local address.   Go to that same site and you can change/add info.
So, I opened up a  urlLink bank  account today and less than ONE HOUR later they call me up asking if I want to upgrade my account.  Lovely!

Why does Treetop's Berry Juice contain pear juice, apple juice, grape juice and finally raspberry juice?  I mean, I guess it's  not  false advertising since they didn't call it Berries Juice; There is just a single berry.  When the front says "Berry from 4 fruit concentrates", I would imagine 4 berries concentrates, wouldn't you?
urlLink Pictures  from my birthday!
From now on, all cell phones without some PDA functionality will be referred to as dumbphones.  That is all.
I just googled my site for  urlLink Stair Dismount  and I can't believe I never blogged it before!  There is a new version called  urlLink Truck Dismount  which takes the premise of Stair Dismount (define a few variables, launch the dismount and see how much damage the body takes) but instead of stairs uses a moving truck and a few ramps!  I really shouldn't be playing this at work, but it's terribly addictive.  It has a good mix of complexity and ease of entry.  The complexity is a time sink because you keep tweaking things trying to create bigger crashes and more damaging launches.
Ok, lots more pictures!

* Last question...
Did you have fun filling this out? It was a great way to kill time at work
Jeff and I have started an actual honest-to-goodness workout routine.  We are shooting to work out at least 5 times a week (more depending on work load and possible visitors) and we are going to track our progress.  Currently, we take a notebook with us to record the exercises, weight and reps.  When I get back to work the next day, I update an Excel spreadsheet with the data.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the information, but never fear.  I'm a huge dork; I'm bound to make charts and graphs representing our progress.
Since we also play racquetball every day, we sometimes don't get enough time to do as many exercises as desired.  Yesterday we were able to get through bench press, leg press, rope tricep pushdown, lateral pulldown, left and right obliques, hamstrings, and abdominals.
In the past two days, I found out that a lot of people still check this site at least a few times a week for updates.  Maybe I should give the people what they want!

My car has barely 2,300 miles on it and I already have to make an insurance claim.  I was driving on 520 from my apartment to the good Target in Redmond.  I'm following behind a Red Ford Expedition at a decent distance.  Out of nowhere, I see that he is about to run over a 4'x4' piece of plywood.  The SUV drives directly over it so that it goes between his wheels.  The downforce air pressure from the SUV causes the wood to fly up into the air.
It flips slowly and at just the right angle so that when I PLOW into it, it is like hitting a wall.  Most of the board shatters into hundreds of car-scratching pieces but one 1.5'x1.5' chunk sticks to my bumper since I'm driving 60 MPH.  I pull off to the shoulder, slow down, the piece slides down and I run it over (possibly causing unseen tire damage).
I just called the insurance agent and thankfully it will be covered.  Unfortunately, the adjuster is booked until next Saturday and I will have to pay my $250 comprensible deductible.  Oh well, I'm not that upset.  If I had bought a sports car, I would have been a bit peeved.

It looks like the  urlLink second expansion for Neverwinter Nights  is going to finally resolve some serious issues with the game (especially issues Chris has with the game):
Lack of a kensei => New prestige class, weapon master
Inability to see much of a playing field => Unlocked camera, meaning you can swing the view around to just about anywhere in the hemisphere above the floor around the character
Boring henchmen => New scripting elements including romance
Two character party maximum => Ability to bring along two henchmen
urlLink It\92s your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet. How do you react? : Questions asked of San Fransisco mayoral candidates taken from  Do Android Dream of Electric Sheep .

So, the trip to New York City\85   my first time, actually.  I\92ve been to a few large metropolises before:  Detroit, San Francisco, Atlanta, Boston, Seattle, Orlando and Toronto to name them all.  NYC is completely different from all of them and it starts with the ambiance.
Starting out in Times Square had to affect my perception dramatically, though.  The overall feeling that spewed from the city wasn\92t the common perception of impatience, snobbery or discourteousness, but one of surging energy.  As Leah said, there is just so much to the city given that there are so many different sectors, each with its own life force.   Time Square was bursting with this power because of the sheer vivacity (tactless extravagance) and curiosity (aimless tourists).
We also visited the rest of midtown, much of the upper East and West sides, downtown and even touched some of the NYU campus.  Blast to the fact that I didn\92t have my camera that night:  there is a cube almost identical to the one on the UMich campus!  The only difference is that theirs didn\92t spin.  As Leah and I noticed it and walked near, someone hopped out of the car at a red light.  He scampered over the cube and tried to give it a push.  He hopped back into his car and then gestured to his passenger that he knew of a cube that rotated.  I yelled to him \93The one in Ann Arbor spins, eh?\94 and he looked back, slightly bewildered and replied in the affirmative.
Since Leah had just turned twenty one the previous week, we hit a few bars during the trip.  She had received a few suggestions from coworkers and with the power of Pocket Streets on my Pocket PC, we hunted them down.  First problem:  one of the bars was called Bowery.  When I pulled a \93Find Place\85\94, it found Bowery alright.  It wasn\92t until we were in the heart of Chinatown with no one around that I realized that it found a street called Bowery and had simply shown me the centermost location on that street.  We used the Pocket PC to locate the nearest bar she had been recommended, headed in that direction, but ended up going to the closest bar we saw.  It was called Pioneer and wasn\92t too bad of a place.
It was only 11:30 PM and while the bars in Ann Arbor or Seattle would be full at that time, NYC bars are open until 4 AM and don\92t seem to swell until 1:30 AM.  There were about 25-35 people inside total, but you couldn\92t tell by the noise level.  The DJ was blaring a mix of old and new dance (pop mostly) though no one was dancing and everyone had to yell over the music to hear each other.  Nonetheless, we had fun.  A few (expensive) drinks later, our tongues were looser and we both learned something.  Though I paid $7 for a shot, that wasn\92t anywhere near as bad as $26 for a Woo Woo (vodka, peach schnapps and cranberry juice) and a Cosmopolitan when we saw Cabaret!
Cabaret was the first show we saw, but it did pale in comparison to Long Day\92s Journey into the Night.  Jon Secada as the MC?  He can sing, but he cannot dance or act.  The actress that played Sally (Melinda Karakaredes (sp?)) did more than an admirable job.  I had seen the 1972 version of Cabaret with Liza Minelli, but I do believe that I fell asleep through part of it.  I could follow the story well since I had seen the movie, even if I couldn\92t understand some of the lyrics of some of the songs.
Long Day\92s Journey into the Night was our first idea for the trip.  It was closing weekend, Leah had heard nothing but good reviews and it had Brian Dennehey *and* Philip Seymour Hoffman!  Even though those seem like bigger names to me, it was Vanessa Redgrave that stole the show.  She had a much more difficult role to play and she absolutely sold it.  It was a character piece, and thus I was a huge fan.  Hoffman\92s role seemed small and insignificant at first, but then the final scene changed all of that.  Read the book or watch the movie to see what I mean.
The three museums we hit (Met, Whitney and Guggenheim) simply reinforced my ideas about art.  If it does not show technical ability or is not visually appealing (very subjective), then it\92s worthless.  I still dislike watercolors and most modern art, still like primary colors, pale orange and brown against white and silver, Mondrian and Rotko, Meiji period Japanese art, geometric abstraction and period fusion (example:  an series of WWII-style Japanese bombers in the shape of an infinity symbol over a burning current-day mid Manhattan done in the style of Edo period Japanese room screens using mother-of-pearl inlay and gold).  I probably spent more time in museums in the past four days than I have in the past 10 years combined.  No complaints.
Well, that\92s it.  Pictures to come.

The site seems to be operating at 100% efficiency again!  I'm not exactly sure what caused the slowdown, but my suggestion to my website admin is what caused the latest problems (eg  urlLink gallery  was broken)!  I noticed that the log files for apache were reaching sizes larger than 1.3  GB , so I suggested rotating the logs.  When apache was restarted, it was mistakenly restarted in chroot mode (a security feature that we don't really need) and that broke just about everything.  My  urlLink home dir website  was down,  urlLink gallery  was down, etc.  Another quick email and things are back up again!

Damn you, AT&T Wireless.  So the new Smartphone is finally coming to market and it is being heavily marketed.  AWS is going to have a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal on launch day and everything.  The new phone is being sold for under $300, which is actually a great price point for the hardware and services being offered.  The device is being sold internally to Microsoft at a 45% discount, which is also amazing.
The problem is that AWS plans are so expensive!  Internally, the two plans being offered are $76/month and $95/month for 700 and 1,100 voice minutes respectively and 30 MB of data.  That is just WAY too much.  I thought spending $50 on my Sprint phone was overkill.  For unlimited data and 1,100 voice minutes, the price jumps to $109!  Come on.  Also, get this, those are the Microsoft discount rates!  For 1,100 minutes, it is normally $120 without data!  I feel like screaming.
No cellular service is worth that much.
Ugh and double ugh.  My current project at work has proved next to impossible and the deadline is being to peek over the horizon.  Basically, I need to categorize various bug fixes.  The difficult portion of this project is that I'm given the updated source code for each bug fix but the report needs to know the final location in our image of these fixes.  From what I've seen, there is no way to trace a source file to the eventual binary file in the image.
I thought I had a good idea to build the image, apply the changes, rebuild and see which files changed.   I did that to a very small bug fix and 10% of the files changed (~1000)!  I figured that had to be wrong so I compiled the full image, made no changes then compiled again.  I saw that roughly 10% of the files had changed again.  This is going to be tough to figure out.
A few nights before she left, Jamie and I made a  urlLink great   urlLink dinner .  Nothing quite like steak, red skin garlic mashed potatoes, broccoli and a bottle of Pinot Noir!
I'm starting to enjoy wine for quite a few reasons:
If it isn't cheap, it almost always tastes good.  There are thousands of varieties and I have yet to find a (non cheap) bottle that I didn't like!
It complements the flavors of so many foods.  I'm not going to start drinking it with pizza and burgers but it works with most everything else.
Maybe it's just my lack of wine drinking experience, but that stuff hits me hard!  Two glasses of wine has the same potency as six beers to me.
I enjoyed the first Max Payne enough to complete it twice (which is quite the rarity nowadays), so I've had some interest in  urlLink Max Payne 2 .  From the screenshots that were released early on in the development cycle, I wasn't too excited.  Now,  urlLink gameplay videos  are available and they have definitely changed my tune.  It's like they took all of the good aspects of the original game and improved upon them.  Bullet time looks cool and useful, unlike in the first game where it was a necessary evil.  Another thing I just noticed is that the object physics seem to be even better than the UT2K3 engine!
Someone recently asked me to suggest a digital camera to these specifications:
Small/compact
Expandable memory (at least up to 512 MB)
3x optical zoom
4 megapixels
My suggestion turned out to be for the  urlLink Canon PowerShot S400 .  After looking around for cameras, I realized that the S400 is smaller and has better resolution than my S30 and costs the same price new.  Silly technology improvements.
While whale watching, I encountered the only problem I have with my camera:  weak optical zoom.  Considering that the optical zoom on my S30 is only 3x and very few consumer-level digital cameras offer anything greater, I think I will have to stick with it for now.
urlLink EMusic.com  is  urlLink changing drastically .  Gone are the days of 2000 downloads a month for $9.95 (well, $14.95/month for 3 months).  I  urlLink had a subscription  and I'm now glad that I cancelled it.  The new plan is $9.99/month for 40 downloads or $14.95/month for 65 downloads.  Given that Emusic.com mostly carries indie, most of my downloads were hit-or-miss.  I'd try something out just because they suggested it and sometimes it was great but more often it was deleted.  Now that the downloads are so restricted, usage patterns are going to be changed drastically as well.
The site should be euthanized.
Wow, the Wings season begins  urlLink tonight !  Being out in WA now, I'm curious as to how many games I'm going to be able to catch.  Tonight's game is on ESPN2, but I have flag football practice at 6 PM and the game starts at 4:30 PM (PST).  I'm curious as to how the goalie situation is going to work out and how Hatcher is going to fit in with our team.  I doubt we are going to win the cup, but I'm still going to follow the Wings heavily.  Since Seattle and even WA doesn't have a hockey team, I'm completely allowed to root for the Wings!

Ok, so in light of the  urlLink car rental fiasco , I decided to add car rental coverage to my insurance.  I got a bit curious as to what my insurance rates would have been had I purchased a different car.  I used Progressive's online quote service and got some interesting numbers.   Note, the quote I got for my car was $1,439 while in all reality I pay about half of that.  For comparison purposes, I'm going to take $700 from each of the numbers I got.  That should be more realistic:
2003 Ford Focus ZX3
2003 Ford Focus SVT
2003 Subaru Impreza WRX Sedan
2003 Subaru Impreza WRX Sport Wagon
2004 Mazda RX-8
2003 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution
2003 Nissan 350z
Alright  urlLink Lindsay , let's see if I can match your dream posts.
The first dream I had was more of a nightmare.  Basically, two shady guys were going door to door trying to sell Smartphones to people.  They had about 40 of the phones just tossed into a big plastic box.  I don't remember actually letting them into the house, but all of a sudden they were both in my parents kitchen trying to sell us AR11s.  As a side note, the  urlLink AR11  is our most hated device.  It would never see a retail market because it has so many problems.
Anyway, at first they were lackadaisically trying to get us to each buy a phone.  It seemed that they were both very tired, worn out and just wanted money.  It also seemed as if all the phones were stolen, obviously.  When we refused to buy a phone, they started to argue and yell at us.  Eventually, I took things into my own hands and started to beat on the leader of the two guys.  I didn't hurt him too much and suddenly he was gone.  I shoved his companion out the door and he rested against a parked car.
Now this is where it starts to get weird and will be hard to imagine.  So picture that you are looking out the door of a house onto a driveway.  From your vantage point, you can see just the backend of a car parked in the driveway.  The second bad guy that I tossed out of the house was leaning against the car, facing the door.  He wasn't looking directly at me, but basically looking at the ground.  He seemed exhausted and looked to be resting a bit before moving on.   Suddenly and without warning, you see just a glimpse of the first shady guy come into the picture as he drops an axe down on the skull of the second guy, practically cleaving it in two!  For some reason, I busted out of the house and ran past both the man wielding the axe and his now-dead accomplice.  I felt that I was being chased a bit and then I felt everything had changed.  I looked around, and the man with the axe was now laying on his back on the hood of a different car.  His axe seemed to have bashed him directly in the face.   I focused past that and saw my mom's friend Evelyn holding a smoking gun!  I can only assume that while he was chasing me, she shot him in the back, he fell back onto the car and then his axe fell onto his face.  I woke up after that one.
The second dream is fairly hazy, but I know some details.  The scene was the last day of class in presumably high school.  It was more like a boarding school because not only did we have to clean out our desks and say goodbye to students and teachers but we had to pack up our bedding and clothes as well.  I'm sure this has something to do with me reading so much Harry Potter lately.  I know there was some crying and there was a dark haired female teacher that we were all sad to say goodbye to.  The next thing I know, I'm getting married!  I don't remember much of the details, but it seems that in the dream I had a wedding and got married to Jamie, then we divorced, then I was getting married to someone else not a month later.  Weird.
Ok, let's play with some numbers.  Here are the current  urlLink WRC  standings:
(57 pts) Richard Burns
(55 pts) Sebastien Loeb
(53 pts) Carlos Sainz
(48 pts) Petter Solberg
(43 pts) Markko Martin
(38 pts) Marcus Gronholm
Burns is on a downward slope.  If his performance in Italy is any indication of his desire to win the championship, we can all but write him off.  Expect Burns to score maybe 8 more points over the last three rallies.  Loeb is hot now, but he is also inexperienced.  His car is sick, so if he can avoid a major retirement in Britain he is going to pull down at least 15 more points.  Sainz is too experienced to drop out of this championship without a fight.  He won't partake in any major gambling, but he will be consistant.  I'll give him 12 points.  Petter knows he needs to score some serious points to vault into the championship, so he will twist his natural talent into desperation.  At least two early retirements will keep him below 8 more points in the final rallies.  Markko is going to destroy the next two rallies.  Expect a first and a second place finish.  The final rally in Great Britain is going to decide this championship.  Gronholm has retired from the last three rallies.  Expect another two retirements with a third place race to finish off the season.  The final standings and points:
(70 pts) Sebastien Loeb
(69 pts) Markko Martin
(65 pts) Carlos Sainz
(64 pts) Richard Burns
(56 pts) Petter Solberg
(44 pts) Marcus Gronholm
You heard it here first.
Deciding to change my own oil may have been a bad call and I haven't even done it yet!  After calling around to four different oil change shops in the area, I decided to do it myself.  The cheapest I found was $25 and that was at a place I wouldn't trust.  I ran to Napa auto parts and purchased six quarts of Mobil 1, oil filter, filter wrench, funnel, shop rags and wheel ramps.  $70 in initial costs and an estimate of about $31 per additional oil change means I'm going to spend more money to do it myself!  Granted, the prices that I was quoted for an oil change was not for synthetic oil.  I guess it is more respectable to change your own oil...   nah, I screwed up.
Car update:  So, you all know about the damage to my car ( urlLink original condition ,  urlLink information ,  urlLink damaged condition ).  For some reason when I signed up for auto insurance, I didn't elect to add rental car coverage.  My thought was simply that I doubt I will ever need to make a claim and if so it would only be for a couple of days.  I figured that if I needed to rent a car, paying for two days wouldn't be so bad.  Sigh, such stupidity.
I took my car in two Mondays ago (09/22/2003) and expected to have it back by Wednesday.  When I dropped it off, they said it would be done by Friday at the latest.  Oh well, what can I do, I need a car so I will just pay for 5 days.  Friday rolls around and the car is not ready.  That sucks because the shop is closed on the weekends meaning at least three more days of renting the car.   Monday comes and the car is not ready.  Tuesday comes and the car is not ready.  Finally I pick up the car on Wednesday (10/01/2003) and they got the wrong fog lamp in so that wasn't replaced.  Total charge for renting a car for ten days:  $375!  All because I didn't want to pay the $60/year for car rental coverage.
Dan owns a timeshare on a plane; a plane!  Man, I really need to learn to save my money.
Endurance races in Gran Turismo 3 are a bitch!  The easiest one, im my opinion, is the Roadster race.  All of the cars are stock roadsters, so it's fairly easy to get a useable car from the start.  I used a Mazda LS with super-slick (AKA high-endurance) tires.  It took over 70 minutes to complete 40 laps, but I demolished the competition!  I lapped everyone and almost double lapped the slowest car.  There are four possible cars you can receive after winning this race (F688/S F1, Mazda Miata, Mazda Miata 1.8 RS or Mazda Miata RS) and of course I got the worst one (the plain Miata).  Sigh.

Another night, another crazy dream though I can only rememeber a few details from this one.  Basically, I was a spy and my boss was the developer lead for my team.  My first task was to assemble a disguise that would let me infiltrate the ranks of my target.  It required some sort of black cape, weird black boots, a wig and makeup to look like an old woman and four old, silver coins.  I started to assemble this disguise and eventually realized it would not work and came up with a different one.  I had on tight black pants, black dress shoes, a beige collared sweater (sort of like this  urlLink one  but with a collar) with the collar up.
Now that I had my disguise (if you can even consider that a disguise), I had to infiltrate the target location.  From my surroundings, the locale was possibly the city of New York, but checking my maps showed St. Petersburg.  So, yes, I was infiltrating a Russian installation.  From here, the rest of the dream is very fuzzy.  I do remember getting onto an elevator and having a woman roll her eyes viciously.
I do remember some of the emotions that I felt.  When I was performing the first task, I knew that I was taking shortcuts and that my boss would be upset if he found out.  I believe the same thing happened when I was actually on my way to the base.  I was using some sort of device to track my location (probably a  urlLink Windows Mobile  powered device, naturally) and that was against the rules of engagement.
So in the past two weeks of flag football, my team has lost 58-0 and 28-2.  Last week, my QB didn't remember how to hand off the ball and I plowed into him.  The starting QB and the starting RB, plowing directly into each other.  Too bad I was the taller of the two as my nose connected to his forehead.   The blood started flowing immediately.  This week, I jammed my middle finger on my right hand before the game started.   That wouldn't have been that bad but I was starting QB!  I couldn't feather out my floating passes like I wanted to and the team can't catch bullet passes.   I gave up five interceptions, I believe.
I just realized that I have never attended class drunk.   Oh well, there is always grad school!
About a week ago, I sent out an email to just about everyone in my address book that didn't live in Washington.  The email outlined my new contact info for both home and work and that's about it.  Well, some people didn't seem to appreciate this information:
From lwashnoc@yahoo.com
Date: Mon, 6 Oct 2003 18:04:05 -0700 (PDT)
From: Laura Washnock-DiPietro
To: mbibik AT umich DOT edu
Mike,
I want you to stay completely out of my life, that is, after all, why I
broke up with you.  This means that I do not want to hear from you and I
do not want you contacting, in any way, my friends and family.  Trust me,
they do not want to hear from you either.  I did not email you earlier
because I did not want to talk to you.  I don't care about your new
address and phone number.  I don't care about your new job.  In short, I
don't care about what you are doing with your life.  I also do not care
for you to know what is going on in my life.
If you are looking for closure, here it is.  I broke up with you because
you made me miserable.  You were emotionally abusive and controlling.
You put me down and made me feel stupid for being myself.  When I broke
up with you, I was too afraid of you to be this direct.  I am not anymore
and I am sick of you trying to weasel your way back into my life.  Leave
my friends alone.  Leave my family alone.  Leave me alone.
Laura
Seeing as how a regular reply might not be appreciated either and I always need to get the last word in, here is my open letter of reply:
Laura,
First off, relax.  We have not talked since the beginning of this
year.  I sent two emails over that period of time inquiring about your
well-being.  I love how that is considered me trying to weasel my way
back into your life!  I send an email to everyone in my address book about
my new contact info and this is the reply that I get?  That is just a bit
dramatic!
Twice you mentioned leaving your family and friends alone.  I can only
assume that you brought this up because they received the same contact
info email as you did.  Had I known that would upset them so much, I
definitely would have reconsidered sending it to them!  Sarcasm aside, I
will not trust you when you say they don't want to hear from me.  A few of
your friends didn't like me while we were together and I'm sure a few more
switched sides when you broke up with me.  I do know that certain people,
including at least one sibling of yours, think differently.  You may have
requested that they all shun me but that cannot affect their true
feelings.  Who is being the controlling one now?  It's a shame that you
cannot trust them to make their own decisions.
I made you feel stupid?  I'm sorry; I must have acted as a mirror of some
sort, allowing you to see yourself for who you truly are.  It does not take
much for someone whose only intellectual hobby is to watch VH1 for hours
on end to think of themselves as being stupid.  Try reading a book.
Better yet, try challenging yourself!  Outside of your required courses,
did you take anything difficult in college?  I know you didn't make it
into the honors program, but there are some difficult classes offered to
the rest of the school as well.
So, you broke up with me so that I would stay completely out of your life?
Is that how it works?  Why is it that so many other people have the ability
to break up and at least be cordial?  Actually, if I remember correctly,
you have no contact whatsoever with any of your exes.  Why is that?  Do you
understand how to forgive people?  Are your emotional abilities so
black-and-white that once you break up with someone, all emotion toward
them must turn to hate?  Do you even understand how to separate the
concepts of friend and significant other?  Hopefully you will learn with
Alex.  Hey, he was one of my good friends back in elementary school.  He was
probably one of the main reasons why we broke up and still I do not hate
him.  Forgive and forget.
Here is my take on the situation as a whole.  You met Alex while we were
together and while our relationship was having problems.  Having a small
shred of morality, you knew that you couldn't cheat so you decided to
break up with me to be with him.  Though we did have problems, there was
still some good in the relationship.  While you were with Alex, you had to
channel that emotional energy somewhere.  The easiest emotion to channel
into is hate, so there it went!  It is much easier to hate someone with
support from people you are close to so you slandered me enough to gain
this support.  When you saw my latest email, you felt a slight twinge of
interest but you had to kill it.  Instead of forgiving and forgetting, you
redirected that twinge into the anger spewed forth in your email.  For that
emotional outburst, I applaud you.
Even if I am completely wrong, know that you have now proved yourself as
the paragon of emotional puerility you were destined to become.

My apartment complex is comprised of four seperate buildings that share a single underground parking garage.  When Russell and I moved in, we took two of the last parking spots available.  They were over by building B while we lived in building A but it is just a short 30 meter walk across the garage.  Last night after working out, I followed another car into the garage.  They parked over by building A while I parked by building B.  We crossed paths as we went to the opposing building.  I didn't think anything of it, but she called out to me just as I was about to enter the building.  We traded contact info and decided that we should trade parking spots.  She was quite attractive as well; maybe that is why I didn't say anything in the first place.
I no longer like investing.  MSFT posts improved earnings and profits, beats the street estimate by a cent and our stock goes DOWN $2 the next day.  Sigh.
Hmm, factoring in employer contribution, my 401k currently has a return of 57.02% and my stock currently has a return of 32.03%.   I like investing!
As of today,  urlLink Windows Mobile  powered  urlLink Smartphones  are available in the US!   urlLink AT&T Wireless  is carrying the  urlLink Motorola MPx200 .  This is a monumental leap forward for my department.  We have been working on the Smartphone platform for years and we are now in the US market!  The AT&T site is selling the phone for $299, but until 10/28/2003,  urlLink Amazon  has the  urlLink phone for $149.99  (after $150 mail-in rebate).
It is difficult to explain just how powerful these phones are in words.  First off, it's a great phone.  Reception is rarely an issue, audio quality is fantastic and all the features of a regular phone are there.  Combine that with a full-fledged PIM (calendar, contacts, tasks, email), MP3 and video player, Internet Explorer, MSN Messenger, and more!  An additional feature that not many people know about is you can use most of these phones as a wireless modem as well!  Anywhere you go with your laptop, just connect your phone with the provided USB cable and now you are on the internet!
The longer I am in this department, the more I love the products.
urlLink BBC Top Gear : "I'm told that on a track, any track, the [Focus] RS is faster than a Subaru Impreza. Better looking too, but that's not hard."  Haha, I'm starting to agree with all the reports about the looks of the Impreza.  Sorry, Jeff and Joe, it really doesn't look all that hot.  Then again, I almost bought  urlLink this  and even I know it looks like crap.
My god, look at the travel on this  urlLink suspension !  The wheels have to be a good 8-10 inches away from their default height.  The expansion pressure on those shocks must be enormous.
urlLink Seems   urlLink like   urlLink fall  in  urlLink Seattle  (taken from my balcony).
Oh, yesterday's flag football game?  We lost, 52-7.
So last night was the  urlLink big go-karting event  at  urlLink Champs Karting .  Racers:  Katherine, Russ, Jeff, Jeff's sister, Jeff's sister's boyfriend, Lee, Mark, Andy, Kevin, Joel, Dennis, Rob and another Jeff.  It's a shame that Champs online results system is broken because then I could give actual speed numbers.  At Champs, each race is 18 laps and because of the staggered start, the winner is whomever has the fastest single lap.  I raced with Katherine, Mark and Lee.  Mark set the fastest lap of the night (for our group) with a 20.00 flat.  Lee was second with a very close 20.03 and I was third with 20.30.
The track was fairly small but I didn't fully figure it out until about half way through.  As you can see on  urlLink this map , there are a few hairpin turns.  The worst was turn 3.  No matter what I did, I couldn't seem to get enough exit velocity.  If it was a real car, I would have changed the gear ratios for faster low-end acceleration.  I figured out how to gain some serious velocity through turns 1 and 2, but 3 was my down fall.  I'm sure another go at it and I would improve by at least .3 seconds a lap.
Overall, I think everyone had a good time.  Jeff and crew had to leave early since they had just gotten in from across the country that morning.  His sister honestly looked like she pulled two all nighters.  You know that glazed, watery look?  She had a textbook case.  Jeff will probably drag me back there, no worries.
Afterward, Katherine, Russ, Lee and I went to Belltown Billiards.  We were supposed to meet up with Lee's friend Craig, but he never showed.  Everytime I go to the bar, I can never think of a cool mixed drink to order.  I need to work on a list.
So, Katherine works in pharmaceutical sales.  One of the greatest accomplishments in this field is to get one of your drugs into regular rotation at a hospital.  Basically, once the drug has been accepted by the hospital, smaller practices near the hospital will pick it up.  Once it's spread through one area, other hospitals may pick it up soon after.  Getting a hospital to accept your drug is no easy process.  A representative doctor will get drilled about all the details on a drug for hours on end in front of a huge committee.  Kat's father is a cardiologist.  By basically his idea, his impetus and his work, he got one of her drugs approved at the local hospital.  The hospital was not in her territory, so she knew that some of the credit would naturally fall to the territory owner.    Last night after a hard day of work, she got home and checked her email.  Her boss sent out an email to the entire west coast staff including her great great grandmanager.  The announcement basically gave 110% of the credit to this other person and practically put Kat down!  The wording of the email stated that this other person did all of the work, Kat basically helped the morning of the final presentation (implicating that she was late with the work and lazy) and gave very little credit to her father.  Naturally, she was appalled.  It's going to be hard to repair all of the damage that single email has done.  I suggested it was time to start becoming a backstabbing, credit-grabbing bastard like the rest of her coworkers.
So, I decided to add a car to  urlLink my list :
The Porsche 911 Carrera.

When the load gets tough, the tough get loaded.
urlLink AutoWeek - Car News : "Mitsubishi trimmed 146 pounds of \93nonessential\94 items from its already-stellar Lancer Evolution for even more performance. Those items include the wing; HID lights (replaced with halogens); rear wiper; air conditioning; ABS; power motors for the windows, doors, locks and side mirrors; the entire audio system; trim in the trunk; vanity mirrors; rear assist grips; map lights; lots of sound-deadening material and even that little piece of leather wrapping that goes around the parking brake lever."  All that removed and it's only $3,000 cheaper.  I'll pass.
urlLink UPDATE - Microsoft turns to IBM for next Xbox chip : "The next version of Xbox is expected to be announced in January by Microsoft founder and Chairman Bill Gates and to be on sale next fall ahead of the holidays, according to Doherty."   A coworker mentioned to me on Wednesday night that Xbox2 would be out in time for next Christmas.  I couldn't believe him, but here is an outside source saying the same thing.  Not that I believe everything on the internet...
How to create an OpenBSD 3.4 ISO:
Download the requisite files from  urlLink ftp://ftp.openbsd.org .  (I would suggest ports.tar.gz, src.tar.gz, sys.tar.gz and the entire i386 folder.)
On your old OBSD machine (since you all have one), cd to the root of the new CD
Use mkhybrid to make an ISO:  mkhybrid -b i386/floppy34.fs -c boot.catalog -l -J -L -r -o obsd34.iso .  (That final period is necessary!  Isn't it always?)
urlLink Howstuffworks "How Dieting Works" : "Try wearing form-fitting clothes instead of sweats. The tight clothing acts as a subliminal reminder of what you are trying to accomplish."  Best dieting advice I've heard all year!
I need to cut caffeine again.  As stated in this  urlLink survey , my sleep requirements went from 8.5 to 5 hours when I quit caffeine.  I wasn't exactly sure if it was the lack of caffeine or the dramatic increase in exercise that was the cause of the change.  Now that I'm still working out just as much (or more) and I'm back on caffeine, my sleep requirements are back at 8.5 hours.
It wouldn't be such a bad thing if I wasn't falling asleep at inopportune moments...

On a much less grisly and much more important note, Kat turns 24 today!
So I'm back to including a bit of cardio into my exercise regime.  On Tuesday, Jeff decided he wasn't up for racquetball so we did 30 minutes of cardio before lifting.  I hit the elliptical for that entire time, burning over 400 calories.  Lifting directly afterward felt so much different than normal where we start with lifting.  Basically, every exercise seemed at least 15% more difficult.  Anytime I have to grunt through an entire set of bench presses, I shouldn't be doing that much weight (nor does anyone actually want to hear me grunt).  Last night, Jeff had two futbol games to play with his MS club so I hit the gym alone.  Again, 400 calories on the elliptical.
Many people have commented on my increased size (I've assumed musculature so far since most of these people wouldn't say "Man, looking a little pudgy there, Mike!"), but I feel that all the added muscle mass is simply pushing the existing fat out farther.  I'm almost tempted to scale back lifting in favor of cardio, but then I wouldn't be making progress in strength.  I've added at least 25 pounds to my bench since we started working out at the end of the summer.  Maybe I should just get liposuction and keep lifting!
When ordering a corduroy schoolboy jacket, I really wish online sites wouldn't shorten my order to "corduroy schoolboy".  I have some decency, honest!  I would never order a schoolboy if he was from Couduroy.
urlLink FCC allows home numbers to be switched to wireless phones - Nov. 11, 2003 :  When I first read this article, I thought "Great!  So many people will love this feature."  Now that I really think about it, how much use is this really going to get?  Ever since cell phones became popular, adding a new phone number became a routine occurance.  It is not that big of a deal to change a phone number.  I could have a skewed viewpoint because almost everyone that has my phone number also has an email address.  Everytime I changed phone numbers (which happened every year in college and once again when I moved out to Washington), I've sent out an email announcing the change.  It could be much more difficult for other people that do not have an alternate form of communication.
I can see this being used by people that ran a business line in their home.  They can keep the same number, which is probably on business cards, websites, etc but now have it tied to a mobile phone.  Since I work in the mobile phone industry, any way to get more people to switch is fine with me!
I do see one issue with this ruling though.  Up to this point, I believe that telemarketers relied on the fact that cell phones and landlines were completely seperate.  They knew which extensions mobile operators had and would not call those numbers (since it is illegal to telemarket to a cell phone since it costs the customer money).  Now, that line is completely removed.  Is there going to be a national database of cellular versus landlines?  How secure would that be?
Being constantly screwed over by your job but still being paid well and not wanting to ruin your resume by quitting before you put in two years has to be one of the most frustrating situations in the world.
urlLink Brits ready for face off : "In a key report to be published on 19 November, members will highlight a catalogue of concerns - focusing on the huge psychologicaland emotional difficulties patients associated with having a dead person's face."
urlLink Motor Trend Names Toyota Prius 2004 Car of the Year .  I think I just found a reason to cancel my Motor Trend subscription (six days after I just renewed for two more years...).  How in the world is the Prius the car of the year?!  I believe that a car with at least a single, glaring issue should not be in contention for car of the year.  The issue with the Prius?  The back end.  Just look at the boot on that car.
Toyota design engineers:  "So, we've simply run out of ideas.  We tried inverting the emblem and the lights and the fender, we've tried square tail lights, round tail lights, clear tail lights (damn Altezza), round back ends, square backends, triangle back ends, full trunks, full hatchbacks, half and half, we've tried everything!  Well, almost everything.  Let's try to 'reverse psych' our customers.  We are going to take the ugliest rear known in existence, the Pontiac Aztec, and then squish it into half the space and give it clear tail lights!  Briliant!"  Ugh.
Just tonight, Jeff, Dan and I were discussing who are the worst drivers.  It may be stereotypical, but women are not as good of drivers on average as men.  Case in point, while waiting to turn left at a light, Jeff and I saw two cars pass that did not have their headlights on: both women, both on cell phones.
"A man will fall in love with some beauty, with a woman's body, or even with a part of a woman's body and he'll abandon his own children for her, sell his father and mother, and his country, Russia, too.  If he's honest, he'll steal; if he's humane, he'll murder; if he's faithful, he'll deceive." - Dostoyevsky,  The Brothers Karamazov
urlLink SCO Hints at *BSD Lawsuits Next Year, And More :  Best quote from the whole SCO fiasco about Darl McBride, "Darl is like a blind man on the street, swinging a bat, hoping someone will pay him to stop. Hopefully, the cops will get him before he does any real damage."
Here is a picture of the puppy that Russ and I almost decided to keep:
urlLink Microsoft OTG RAS Extranet site .   This is for my own personal use; stay out.
Animals, animals and more animals.     Russell's older brother is currently studying to be a veterinarian.  Before we moved in together, Russ mentioned that he might want to get a dog eventually.  Back then, I stated that I wouldn't have any problem with that whatsoever as long as he was the one to take care of the dog.  I wouldn't mind having to ocassionally fill a food dish or take the pup out for a walk, but that would be about it.  The topic was dropped then, but Russ' brother recently had to spay/neuter a puppy for his studies.  Usually, these dogs are mutts from the Humane Society, but this one turned out to be a purebred doberman pinscher.
Since this dog was just so darned cute, Russ had to bring up the idea of getting a dog since his brother could give it away to anyone.  I said the same thing as before but pointed out that this dog wasn't going to be small for very long.  Also, he would probably destroy something if he was kept in the apartment by himself for 10+ hours a day.  We agreed, no puppy for us.
Kat and her parents have a total of three cats.  Two of them, Charlotte and Emily (the "Bronte Sisters") have been with the family for quite a few years now.  They are a mix between what seems to be to be a Russian Blue or Chartreux and an orange English Shorthair.  The third cat is Sebastian, a brown tabby, and is only 6 months old.  Emily is fairly social, so it wasn't much of a surprise when she felt comfortable enough to come up to me.  The other two are a different story.  Sebastian is still in the playful kitty phase, but Kat told me that I'm the only person other than herself that he has cuddled with. As for Charlotte, she isn't terribly social so Kat is also surprised when she always comes up to me for affection.  I think Kat is just jealous!
Kitties love me.
urlLink Totally Sidetalkin' Nokia N-Gage Style!! SIDETALKING 2003 :  Oh my god, my eyes are watering this is so hilarious!    So, some of the newest Nokia phones are shaped pretty much like a taco.  Instead of holding the taco flat to your face to talk, which would seem normal, you hold the edge of the phone (AKA bottom of the taco) against your face to talk.  I thought I looked dorky with my Pocket PC Phone, but that just takes the cake.  Observe:

My parents requested that I take pictures of my fully furnished apartment a few months ago.  I delayed because, well, the apartment still isn't fully furnished.  Additionally, the apartment is usually a complete mess.  Since I had today off, Russell was gone, all of my friends are out of town and Kat was busy until dinner time, I decided to clean the place from top to bottom.   urlLink Here  are those long-awaited pictures.
You never know how hard it is to find an available dumpster until you need one.  I just spent 20 minutes driving around a dark and rainy Bellevue looking for such a creature.  I needed to dispose of a few plastic containers that I used to move in and our apartment complex only offers a chute for trash bags.  These plastic totes barely fit into my hatchback, so they sure as heck were not going to fit down that chute.
Thankfully, there is a large string of medical centers about a block from here because of the hospital being so close.  Friday night at 5 PM, the day after a holiday, few people are going to be in the office.  I found a dumpster and it found my totes.
Here is the cake:   urlLink pic1  and  urlLink pic2 .
Thanksgiving with Kat's family was quite enjoyable.  From talking with her mom to playing with the cats to playing board games with everyone, a good time was had by all.  Note to self: the combination of turkey, rich chocolate cake and port means you will fall asleep very soon after the meal.

I get to make my chocolate raspberry torte for Thanksgiving at Kat's parents this year!  Every time I've made it, it's been a hit.  I have an idea to improve it dramatically this year.  I will make it the day before Thanksgiving and if it fails, I will make the original recipe.
urlLink Ford to drop SVT Focus, put entire SVT lineup on hiatus :  No more SVT Focus!  That is a shame because just about every review I've read of the car said it was outstanding.  I really shouldn't think about the SVT too much because I want to kick myself for getting the ZX3 instead.  The retail price on my ZX3 was MORE than a well-equipped SVT and the SVT is a better vehicle in almost all regards (other than noise and softness of ride).  170 HP, almost as fast as a 911 Carrera in the slalom, okay gotta stop thinking about it.  If only I was more comfortable with a manual, I would have bought it back in July...
Anyway, back to the article.  The ST model that is mentioned is probably similar to the UK-spec ST170:  basically the same engine as the SVT (170 HP) but without the rest of the upgrades (suspension, tires, brakes, interior, transmission, etc).
Weekend update:
On Sunday, I finally made it to a donation center.  When I first moved out to Washington, I brought all of my college apartment furniture, electronics and applicances.  I figured that I would have enough startup costs with moving into a new apartment and buying a car that I could use my old college crap for awhile to get me by.  I dropped quite a bit on the down payment for the car and had to buy a few essentials for the apartment (sofa, bed, desk, dresser, bookshelves, everything for the bathroom, etc) so I was glad I brought everything else.  I've slowly replaced a few items and instead of getting rid of them immediately, I just tossed them into the corner of the room!  Basically, we had an extra TV, VCR and TV stand in our living room for the past three months.  Kat showed me the local Goodwill donation center Sunday morning so I packed up the ol' Focus hatchback and finally made a donation.
I got rid of said TV, VCR and TV stand along with two huge garbage bags of clothes (cleaned and folded, thank you), microwave, toaster, coffee pot and some other assorted items.  They didn't take the TV, so I just tossed it into the garbage/recycle room in my complex.  If it's still there after trash day, I will probably take it to a real recycle center since Jeff informed me that the tube contains toxic materials.
After getting rid of so much stuff, I decided I need to fill those now-empty spaces with new stuff.  I picked up a duvet cover and blanket (both in dark blue) and then Jeff and I went out shopping.  On the way to Ikea, we decided to check out Fry's.  It can only be described as a combination of the best parts of Best Buy and Radio Shack in a Wal-Mart sized setting.  Automatic geekgasm.  At Ikea, I picked up a  urlLink frame  for my  urlLink Hokusai Katsushika  print.  It's not terribly Japanese, I know, but I simply like it for aesthetic reasons.  Jeff had to continually remind me that I am heterosexual so that I wouldn't  urlLink buy   urlLink certain   urlLink prints .  But come on, with a blue and white theme in my bedroom,  urlLink this  would complement it well!
On Saturday, Jeff, Russ, his two visitors, Rebecca and Rob, and I went to  urlLink Rocksport  in West Seattle to see  urlLink Michigan defeat Ohio State .  I was about to say "upset Ohio State", but we all knew who was going to win!  Rocksport was an interesting place to see the game.  All but a handful of people were there specifically to cheer on the Wovlerines as the Seattle alumni association goes there for every game.  They served (a fairly crappy) breakfast, but service was surprisingly good for a bar at 9 AM.  After the game, Jeff and I hit Kenneth Cole ( urlLink shoes  in brown/tan,  urlLink shirt ,  urlLink shirt  in black).  After a quick lunch, we hit the gym.  That night, Kat and I went to Cutters for dinner (not terribly impressed) and then had a quiet night at home.
urlLink Mitsubishi announces Lancer WRC04 :   After taking a year off from rallying, Mitsubishi has returned with a radical new vehicle to enter the '04 WRC season.  The overall body shape has remained similar to previous Mitsu WRC cars, but the underlying construction, components and technologies are radically different.
Personally, I am not a fan of the looks of the new car.  I can definitely see how it would be more aerodynamic than the last model, but they needed to make a few sacrifices in the visual appeal area.  There is another small picture of the design available on the  urlLink official WRC site .
urlLink CBS 2: New Jersey Wire :   Mmmm, quick thinking.   My kind of man.
urlLink The Metrosexual Quiz :   Haha, Jeff sent me this.  Of course I scored high!  "You're a metrosexual. The next girl you hook up with will be more masculine than you, full mustache and all. Is it time to buy new tweezers?"

Well I dragged Kat out to Greek food (Orexi) last night.  I think that was our last time!  Basically all of the food was overcooked.  She normally likes spanokopeta but not when it's that well-done!  My dolemades were fine but she didn't like those either.
Maybe we should stick to American and Italian.
I need to pay better attention to the various discounts that MS employees get.  Kat and I have been to Andiamo twice in about the past month and now I find out I can get buy 1, get 1 free.
I cant use gallery to upload pictures through the web either!
What this needs is a way to do pictures from the built-in camera and it would be great!

Well, it's official:  I'm coming back to Detroit twice in the span of about two weeks!  I will be flying into Detroit just so I can turn around and drive to Chicago (don't ask) for New Year's Eve.  After the festivities, I will be driving back to Detroit to see family and friends for a few days before flying back to Seattle.  A week later, I will be flying out to Detroit for a long weekend to attend the  urlLink auto show .  Here are the details:
Trip 1:
31/Dec/2003 @ 9:25 AM EST: Arrive in Detroit
31/Dec/2003 @ 2:00 PM EST: Drive to Chicago
01/Jan/2003 @ 5:00 PM EST: Drive to Detroit
04/Jan/2003 @ 5:00 PM EST: Fly to Seattle
Trip 2:
16/Jan/2003 @ 5:30 AM EST: Arrive in Detroit

So, everyone back in the SE MI area, if you want to see me, you better call dibs now!
urlLink Yahoo! News - Asian Pirates Sell Microsoft's Next Windows System : "Underscoring the scale of U.S. companies' copyright problems in Asia, CDs containing software Microsoft has code named "Longhorn" are on sale for six ringgit ($1.58) in southern Malaysia."  Haha, he said ringgit.
I'm sure my WRX-loving friends (Jeff, Joe, Jenn, Eric, etc) will get a kick out of the  urlLink Saabaru !
Only in Redmond, Washington are you going to find an Acura NSX:

in the mall parking lot and a Ferrari 360 Modena:
urlLink      in your office garage.  I apologize about the quality of that second picture; I had to use the "Dim" mode on my camera phone and that cuts quality in half.  The NSX also had the license plate "SLOW V6", but my picture of that didn't come out.
Yesterday, I was talking to the person on my team that is setting up our holiday party.  We were talking about trying to get a small group of the younger members of the team together for the division-wide holiday party.  I told her that the menu seemed fairly extravagant, so I was definitely going.  She hadn't seen that email and she couldn't find it in her inbox, so she asked me who sent it so she could search for it.  Oddly enough, the first thing that came to mind was "Merlot reduction", since I believe one of the meat dishes featured that.  Her quote "Have you ever heard of the word...   what is it...   metrosexual?"
Everyone thinks of me when they hear that word and now people think of the word when they think of me.  When I told Russ this story, he said he thinks of me every time he hears that word.
Ok, about AX:  This Saturday, I decided that since flag football season was over and Katherine was getting ready to go to Dallas on a business trip, I might as well get started on my holiday shopping.  I spent quite a few hours at  urlLink Bellevue Square  and hit at least 20 stores.  One of the last stores I went to, mostly out of curiosity, was Armani Exchange.  Personally, I hate their clothing.  It's either label-saturated or a misguided attempt at being trendy.  While I was there, I had not one, not two, not three, but four different sales people try to help me.  Normally I walk into a store like that and I'm lucky to get any help.  The last sales person, male, got my attention by staring directly into my eyes for a second.  I turned away, then noticed he was still watching me.  I made eye contact again and he started up conversation.  Most of it was "how is shopping going", "who are you buying for" and basic salesperson chat.  When he said "What are you doing afterward?", that was when I figured out I was being hit on.  My response "Probably just some more shopping." with a condescending smirk ended that discussion.
Remind me to post about being hit on at AX and my coworker calling me a metrosexual.
urlLink iDuck : "Akuma, no one is buying our USB drives!  We need to carve out a niche market and I believe the main problem is that no one wants to carry around something that looks like a dorky pack of gum.  What do kids like nowadays?  My 2 year old daughter loves her toys...   hmm...  I'm getting an idea!  USB drive toys!"
Once again, learning something not from Slashdot, but because of links found there.  Starting with  urlLink this discussion about a nuclear-powered mission to the moons of Jupiter , there was a link to this  urlLink article , stating that crash landing a nuclear-powered probe into Jupiter could cause it to turn into a star.  Basically, this article is full of facts and a gross misuse of these facts.  They have correct information about the Galileo craft and some fairly factual discussion about fission, fusion and bombs.  While it is true that the materials on the craft could be used for a fission bomb, they completely ignored the concept of critical mass.  I couldn't think of the right term while reading the incorrect article, but the question of just how much plutonium was necessary came to mind.
Bad Astronomy saves the day and debunks the possiblity of a small nuclear-powered probe turning Jupiter into a star with this  urlLink article .  The critical (pun intended) points here are:
The plutonium onboard Galileo was kept in small pellets, none of which were near critical mass.
The hydrogen on Jupiter is of the most abundant isotope and lacks deuterium and tritium needed for a fusion reaction.
Jupiter is about 1/80th the size needed to be a self-sustaining star.
I love science.
The most difficult thing in the world is to know how to do a thing and to watch someone else doing it wrong, without commenting.

Ford strives to give SVT models upscale image :  Ok, so  urlLink we already knew  that Ford was going to drop the SVT Focus.  Now we find out that the Focus ST will not have the 170 HP engine from he UK but will be roughly 150 HP.  Not good.  To make up for that power gap, Ford will release a turbocharged Focus in 2005 or 2006.  The estimate is around 200 HP, so this will probably not be the 215 HP Focus RS, unfortunately.

Well, it took me five times.
I just had a pretty crazy dream.   I don't remember all the details, but I know it involved trying to go to a play, or a conference or something.  To me, it seemed like we were in East Lansing, or some other college town that I've visited but didn't know too well.  The overall theme of the dream seemed to concern men versus women, and more specifically, women standing up to men treating them poorly.  Some of the people that were in my dream:  Jenn, Laura, Angie, Steve Jackson from the Daily and some girl that I just barely remember being a friend of Rob and Gareth.
I don't really remember the play/conference/whatever, but I know that we went out to eat afterwards.  The place was called BD's, but instead of it being like BD's Mongolian BBQ, it was more like Dixie's BBQ and was fast food.  The restaurant was so darkly lit that I couldn't even read the menu and was about to just order a "Number 1 Combo" just to be safe when an altercation occured.  Some guy brushed up too close to the girl that I just barely remember and so she yelled at him and shoved him.  A couple of other guys were just loitering around that area and started to make fun of her.  That's when I stepped in, put one of the guys in an arm lock and said "Do you like having the use of this arm?"  He was quiet after that.
Weekend update:
Friday turned out a bit differently than I originally expected. I knew that Kat was leaving for a business trip on Sunday morning and that she would be pretty busy getting ready on Saturday night, so I planned on seeing her.  Around 7:30 PM, Mark called and said that he was going out to some bars downtown with Dan and some friends.  I figured that Kat, Jeff, Russ and I hadn't been out drinking in awhile so I thought we could all get together.  Well, all the stress of trying to close on a new townhome, stress of work and stress of trying to get ready for a week-long business trip caught up to Kat.  She decided that I should just go out with the guys and have fun.  No way!  If this was probably the last night I would get to see her for a week, of course I was going to try to see her.  I basically had to convince her to let me come over and that I would go out with the guys afterward.  We had a fairly quiet night at her place and I tried my damnest to wash away some of her stress.  By the time I got back to my apartment, Russ was sound asleep and Mark never called me to say where he would be downtown.  That ended that night.
Saturday was a bit more productive.  I figured that I wouldn't be able to see Kat at all, so I was going to tackle some Christmas shopping.  Before I got started with that, Jeff and I grabbed lunch at King and I, a Thai restaurant near his apartment.  Not too bad, but their take on "3 star" spicy was definitely including White Man Penalty and was thus fairly mild.  I then headed over to the local mall and spent a good three hours shopping.  I was looking mostly for gifts for my parents but I seemed to find more gifts for myself.  Not surprising.
Kat called me soon after that saying that she was mostly ready for her trip and that we should hang out for a bit.  We originally decided to grab coffee some place, but by the time we actually got around to leaving her place, it was dinner time.  She felt like Mexican, so we started off toward Fremont since she knew of a fairly authentic restaurant out that way.  Traffic over the bridge to Seattle was horrendous, so we turned back to Bellevue.  We hit  urlLink Spazzo , which recently changed from Mediterranean to Italian. and had a fairly nice meal.  The wine was better than the entrees and the goat cheese appetizer was served with bread that was impossibly hard and terribly over-soaked in olive oil.  All in all, a nice evening, as most are with her!
Today was completely lazy...  I didn't do anything productive until 3 PM, unless you count making eggs for breakfast and playing an hour of Grand Theft Auto III as productive.  Russ and I visited  urlLink Caffe Ladro  so I could read more of The Brothers Karamazov and he could study for accounting.  It was good going out with him since we spend so much time in the apartment.
"As I get older, you know, I won't be a pretty object.  The wenches won't come to me of their own accord, so I will need my money.  So I am saving up more and more, simply for myself, my dear son.  You may as well know.  For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell you.  For sin is sweet.  All abuse it but all men live in it.  The only difference is that others do it on the sly and I do it openly.  And so all the other sinners fall upon me for being so simple.  And your paradise, Alyosha, is not to my taste, let me tell you that.  It's not the proper place for a gentleman, your paradise, even if it exists.  I believe that I fall asleep and don't wake up again, and that's all.  You can pray for my soul if you like.  And if you don't want to, don't, damn you!  That's my philosophy."  F.  Dostoyevsky

Since Nokia is my current corporate enemy, I just had to laugh.
Remind me to quote Pg. 172, last paragraph  of The Brothers Karamazov later.
Remind me to post later about my weekend, how Kat is gone for a week and about holiday parties.  Oh, and  urlLink White Ribbon Week  as well.
Just yesterday, I was reading a  urlLink discussion on Fark  about  labels and the common consensus was that people did not want to pay to advertise for a company.  Someone joked that you don't see Armani suits with "ARMANI" written across the front in huge letters.  Someone followed that up with a desire to see an Armani trucker hat.  Well, I went shopping later that day and what did I see:
urlLink    An Armani Exchange trucker hat!  Perfect timing.  I'm starting to enjoy the fact that my phone has a camera now.

"Grushenka was twenty-two years old and her face looked exactly that age.  She had very white skin with a pale pink tint on her cheeks.  The modeling of her face might be said to be too broad, and the lower jaw was set a trifle forward.  Her upper lip was thin, but the slightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full and looked pouting.  But her magnificent, abundant dark brown hair, her sable-colored eyebrows and charming grey-blue eyes with their long lashes woukd have made the most indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd in the street, stop at the sight of her face and remember it long after."

So,  urlLink Walmart  has decided to open their own  urlLink online music service .  My first thought was, Walmart with an online service, up against a formidable opponent like iTunes Music Store?  Then again, people thought the same thing about Microsoft coming out with the XBox to go against Sony and the PS2.  Anyway, this serivce, much like the new Napster, uses WMA 9.  Because of this, no one with a Mac can use this service and this is even mentioned in their  urlLink FAQ .  Oddly enough,
urlLink this page  has a screen shot from a Mac!  Observed first by a  urlLink Slashdot member .
Sorry that I disappeared for a few days there; I have a good reason.  On Monday while playing racquetball, I severely injured my knee again.
Here is how I did it.  Instead of wearing my normal cross-trainer shoes to play rball, I was wearing my turf shoes.  Turf shoes have amazing traction on almost any surface, including the hardwood floor of the rball court.   Whenever I land from a jump, I keep my foot perpendicular to my shoulders until I land, when I rotate my foot away from my body for added balance.  that is how you are supposed to land.  Well, when I landed this time, I went to rotate my foot but my shoe decided to have super traction and not move.  All of the rotational force went straight to the inner portion of my left knee.
It was 10 PM by the time I got home, so I couldn't see a doctor on Monday.  The next morning, I waited until I heard from Kat to make an appointment since I figured her dad (a doctor) would be able to make a good recommendation.  When I called to make an appointment at 11 AM, they were booked for the day and I had to wait until Wednesday.  The x-ray shows that I definitely did some serious damage and that I also have a bone shard taken off the medial portion of my left knee.  Because of the amount of swelling, the doc recommended that I get an MRI.  That was done the same day but I will not get the results until at least Friday afternoon.  The current prognosis is a torn MCL, stretched ACL, torn meniscus and the bone shard.  Lovely.
I'm currently wearing a huge brace but the pain is not so bad.  It comes and goes and luckily I can walk fairly well.  I missed a day and a half of work, so I'm a bit behind now.

Whoa, Saddam captured?   I guess being up at 5 AM has the advantage of knowing the breaking news.
4:15 AM and I've been trying to sleep since 11:30 PM.  The only explanation is that the decaf coffee I ordered during dessert wasn't quite decaf.
Merry Christmas!
I will increase my post frequency soon once my parents go back to Michigan.
Why is it that I had never heard of the terms "bollywood" or "steam punk", yet I've seen both a handful of times just this week?
Disclaimer:  For no real reason, I have always disliked Walmart.  Maybe it was because, for the longest time, there were no Walmarts nearby either my hometown of Livonia, MI or my college town of Ann Arbor, MI.  That has since changed, with stores in or near both cities.  Maybe it was because Walmart always had a southern, poor slant to it.  Maybe it was because we had a similar store, Meijer's, in our area and I was pledging a local allegiance.  For whatever reason, I never liked Walmart.
I've always heard that Walmart was an "evil" company.  From details like hiring illegal aliens for stock and cleaning work to treating "regular" employees poorly to pushing around suppliers, the comments swirled around and painted a dirty portrait.  When I was back working at the Daily with Scott as my manager, he spoke of Walmart as being worse than an other company he knew of.  He had facts from reputible sources, and though being an activist, used them properly.  Now having read this  urlLink article  from fastcompany.com, I'm starting to see the details about how Walmart interacts with suppliers.  From first glance, it does seem evil, overbearing and monopolistic.  At the same time, isn't that what capitalism is all about?  A mostly-free market for companies to do as they please?  Walmart doesn't force smaller suppliers to cut costs, Walmart is just such a large and successful company that the small suppliers need to be up to Walmart standards.
I won't go so far as to condone their practices and I do agree that Walmart needs to improve their human rights issues, but don't fault a company for being successful.
Let's see, what's been going on lately...  Chris and Lindsay are getting married this fall.  Definitely congratulations to them!  I am the best man, so that means I should get started on writing the toast.  I've been best friends with Chris since 1992 and I've known Lindsay for years, so I will have lots of material with which to work.
My knee is slowly healing.  No longer do I need to wear my brace daily, just when exercising.  I no longer limp around and I have full range of motion.  I am supposed to go snowboarding this weekend, but that is not going to happen.  If I really want to heal on time, I need to do more physical therapy.
There is some political crap going on at work, but I can't say much yet.  I still have a job, so I am okay.
So Kat spent the night last night because she had a big day today and her parents wouldn't leave her alone long enough to do her work.  She comes over here, and I set not one but two alarms so that she wouldn't be late for the big day.  Well, I set my bedside alarm clock for 6:30 PM instead of 6:30 AM and my PDA/phone didn't fire the alarm because the phone portion was off.  I'm really sorry.
Altruism, as a concept, exists.  Altruism, as reality, does not exist.
My parents were here for a week during the holidays.  There aren't too many highlights, since we decided to keep the vacation relaxing.  We didn't want it to be one of those vacations where you have to keep to a schedule and cram in as much as possible.  They didn't even go to the Space Needle!  Some of the places we did end up going were Snoqualmie Falls, Pike Place (NOT a good place for someone in a wheelchair) and a casino in Tulalip.  Other highlights include me making five batches of scones, cooking Christmas dinner and then Kat meeting my parents on the last night they were here.  I believe it was beneficial to have them out here, for both parties.  For thier sake, they got to see how I am living my life and meet some of the new people in my life.  For my sake, I got to see them for a little while in the comfort of my own home without having to break much from my normal routine.
Dialing the time machine back to about a month ago...
So, the holiday parties last month.  All three parties were right in a row this year:  Thursday was the organization-wide party at EMP, Friday was the team-wide party at a lodge at Snoqualmie Pass and Saturday was Kat's party at some little restaurant in Puyallup.  Thursday started off very slowly.  I was supposed to meet some of the younger members of my team at EMP around 7:30 PM and eventhough I got there at 7:45 PM, I was still early.  Eventually, everyone showed up and the party picked up.  The food was good, but the two drink tickets didn't last very long.  Being the ingenious people that we are, us Microsoft people, we figured out that we could simply exit the building, come back in, show our ID and get two more tickets.  Of course I didn't do this, but my ID was used by a non-Microsoftie for this purpose.  Afterward, a few of us were supposed to go out to a bar, but we all parted ways for a bit and we were supposed to reconvene 15 minutes later.   15 minutes later, one of the girls still hadn't showed up.  We were all a bit drunk and antsy to get away from the formal party, so we just left.  Four of us went over to a friends place and continued the drinking and watched some TV.  I ended up fitting five people in my car, dropped them all off, and called it a night.
The next day, the team party was supposed to start at 10 AM, but since I knew there was no rush, I didn't end up getting there until 12:30 PM.  The drive up to Snoqualmie Pass was interesting at least for the fact that it was the first snow I had ever seen in Washington.  The farther up the mountain, the more snow there was (shocking, I know).  By the time I hit the exit for the Pass, traffic was down to 30 MPH.  I actually passed someone on my team on the exit, which wasn't surprising since he had a RWD Bimmer with bald tires.  Anyway, most of the day was pretty laid back.  A few of the highlights included me running the white elephant gift exchange (including a box of old Atari games, a Nascar coffee table book and a bike axle), playing DDR, and a snowball fight that included someone in a hot tub.  I picked up Kat from the airport that night, but I can't remember the rest of the evening.
The final day of holiday parties was at some crappy little restaurant in a crappy little town far far south of Seattle.  This was with Kat's coworkers, who had an average age of just about 35.  It was slightly odd socializing with them, but luckily we got a table with the friendliest of the bunch.  The food was horrible, the drinks were crap, and the supposed white elephant gift exchange wasn't!  Kat brought a gag gift, since that's the point of a white elephant gift exchange, yet some of the other gifts included a fondue set, a set of nice martini glasses and a clock from Pottery Barn.  For dessert, I ordered decaf coffee.  Since I was awake until 5 AM and got about two hours of sleep all night, I believe it wasn't decaf.  Anyway, the parties overall were typical work holiday parties.

Taken from Slashdot  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .
urlLink Slashdot :  Woo, Services for Unix is now free!  The most important part is that it is almost completely based on OpenBSD.  Running OBSD tools on Windows sounds like a great fusion to me.
So, I've heard of mice with too many additional buttons to be useful, but thankfully my new mouse just has left click, right click, scroll wheel, scroll up button, scroll down button, task switch and then two currently unassigned buttons that I would assume are used for forward and backward in a web browser.  That may sound like a lot of buttons, but I think of the scroll up and down buttons as just an extension of the wheel and the task switch button is miniscule.    Now the keyboard on the other hand is just asinine.  Along with the normal keys that a normal keyboard has (letters, numbers, punctuation, navigation and keypad), this one has seperate keys for scrolling, go, back, sleep, f-lock, e-mail, messenger/sms, webcam, media, mute, volume up/down, last track, next track, stop, play, iTouch, search, shopping, favorites, and my home.  Additionally to that, it has a function key to enable new, reply, forward, send, undo, redo, print, save, my computer, my documents, my pictures, and my music.  To make matters worse, they labeled the normal control key functions like undo, cut, copy and paste.  They keyboard is just a little bit overboard!
Living in the land of coffee, I have yet to be impressed by the coffee shops available out here.  There is no end to the number of Starbucks available and there is a healthy dose of Tully's as well.  The only place I've enjoyed so far has been Caffe Ladro, and they are only located in Seattle proper.  Well, today I found out about a place in Redmond called Victor's, located at 7993 Gilman St.  I will have to give it a try soon!
So I go to backup my MP3 drive on my server and it crashes, deleting every single MP3 I have collected for the past six years!  I am going to cry.  There was so much effort put into building that collection, from ripping my own CDs to downloading full albums from Kazaa to emusic (which isn't even the same site anymore).  So pissed.
Happy four month anniversary!
Last night, I originally planned on leaving work a bit early, taking a nap, having a quick bite to eat and then hitting the gym with Jeff.  None of that happened!  Around 5:30 PM, Eric and I were talking about the new laptop he just ordered.  I told him not to buy Office from Dell since I could get a good deal on a legit copy of Office 2003 from work.  I decided to run to the company store right then since I was tired and needed a bit of fresh air.  After that, Lee sent me a chat request and convinced me to join him and some of his MS friends for dinner.  We went to Cucina Cucina (a decent to mediocre italian restaurant, thankfully we get 2-for-1 specials) and had a fun time.  It was good to meet new people, but I sometimes forget how horribly dorky we can all be.  I explained how Microsofties and non-Microsofties have difficulty mingling and there needs to be a certain percentage (we estimated 60%) of non-Microsofties for a group to work.
I still planned on going to the gym with Jeff, but he was feeling fairly comfortable at home and wanted to skip it.  Good thing, since Russ called me soon after wanting to get drinks to unwind from a 13 hour day.  We went to  urlLink Tap House , he got dinner and I got a liquid dinner of an Emerald City Tea and a Manhattan.  I pretty much ordered the tea (vodka, gin, rum, midori, pineapple, sprite) because it already looked like Russ and I were on a date, so I had to get something fruity and served in a hurricane glass.  The Manhattan was used to bring up my testosterone levels afterward.  We had a good discussion and I'm glad I skipped working out.  I can always go a bit harder tonight.
Kat and I had quite a relaxing and enjoyable weekend, if I may say so myself.  Originally, we had planned to go to  urlLink Dahlia Lounge  for dinner on Friday, but we both had a hard week and figured we wouldn't be up for such a nice dinner.  Instead, we ended up going to  urlLink Wasabi Bistro  and had some of the best sushi available in Western Washington.  We tried two of their signature rolls, the Spicy 101 and the Belltown.  Other than an overabundance of mayo on the Spicy 101, the meal was great.  Kat had a craving for edamame and that was satisfied by the complementary bowl served with every dinner.
Much of Saturday morning was spent lounging around my apartment, but it was definitely not a waste of time.  Much of the afternoon was spent at Starbucks:  Kat doing work, me just playing around on the internet.  That evening, we made the  urlLink first meal in her new townhome .  We made spinach and cheese ravioli, fresh bread and a mixed greens salad.  All in all, very enjoyable.  Before we could make dinner, however, I had to put together the table and chairs we would need to eat off!  I've gotten pretty good at putting together Ikea furniture, so it didn't take too long.
Sunday saw me fighting with my server for a good part of the afternoon and then having dinner at Kat's parents.  We played a dominos game called Mexican Train and then had a lovely filet dinner.  Her dad and I did most of the talking, but I think everyone enjoyed themselves.
I have now moved to my fourth office in six months.  If anyone takes my stapler, this place is going down!

Mmmm, new  urlLink wireless keyboard and mouse ...   Thanks,  urlLink slickdeals !
It's Fifteen Minute Photoshop&reg; time!
Basically, my bedroom is not in the most optimal configuration.  Both of my tall bookshelves are covering up one window completely and part of another window.  So, I started thinking about alternative arrangements.  Knowning me, I couldn't just visualize this or write it out on a sheet paper, I decided to measure and model my room in Photoshop.
It's pretty hard to see on the left, but there is a long window there.  The upper left red line is another window.  The red line on the right is the bathroom door.  Here is my suggested layout:
This clears both windows (since the dresser fits underneath the window and the sides of the bed are not against the bed) and seems like a good idea.  Bah, no time to do it tonight.
I've been wrestling with hardware issues for about four days now.  That is what I get for naming a server fireball!  Basically, the machine that has been my internet router, NAT box, development web server, database server, RDP proxy has gone through quite a few upgrades.  It originally was my old overclocking desktop (thus, "fireball") running a 300 MHz Celeron.  It was upgraded to a 500 MHz PIII and it currently has a 700 MHz Duron.  A month or so ago, I bought a new 120 GB drive for my desktop (thanks,  urlLink Slickdeals !) and last week I finally got around to putting my old 30 GB drive into fireball.
The problems started then.  Since the 30 GB drive was already in my desktop, I decided to install OpenBSD 3.4 on the drive before transferring it to the server.  That install went smoothly, but the drive would not boot when I transferred it.  I figured it just didn't like the transfer, so I reinstalled OpenBSD while in fireball.  When I tried to boot after the second install, the bootloader would come up with crap like "@$%&@#$&*@#$#$%!@#(&(^%".  After 45 minutes of playing around with the bootloader, the BIOS and the boot sequence, I finally figured out that it wouldn't boot unless the drive was the primary on the IDE chain.  Ok, finally got the new drive up and running!  When installing OBSD, my first steps are to install the ports tree, tcsh, vim, the source and add 'mbibik' as a user.  I got as far as compiling tcsh static when the machine just froze, hard.  I figured, whatever, just a random lockup.   Nope, anytime I taxed the processor, the machine would freeze.  Obviously (at least to me), this seemed like a heat issue.  I opened the case to check out the CPU fan, but it's a fairly small (AKA cramped) case so I couldn't see the fan behind the power supply.  I monitored the CPU temp and it never seemed to get into dangerous territory.
I gave up at this point and told Russell the internet would be down for awhile (no server, no NAT, no internet).  I started to play with it again, but there isn't much you can do when the damned thing freezes every 15 minutes!  I gave up trying to install tcsh, vim, etc and just started surfing the net from my desktop.  Oddly enough, it didn't lock up.  At this point, I realized that interactive activities such as installing or compiling are probably accessing the disk more than just using the box as a router (which would only access the disk to periodically write logs).  I switched back to the old drive, and all is well.  Too bad my 30 GB drive is fried!

Looks like Jeff, his office mate, some other coworkers and I are going to hit a shooting range next week.  In honor of this great event, here are some  urlLink video clips  of things being shot.  My favorite is the wide angle view of the pudding cup spreading it's life force across the screen.
Ok, so I updated the moblogging gallery without posting.  Bad Mike.  Here is a rundown of the updates:

I should have posted this as soon as I woke up this morning, but I can never seem to get going until 1.5 hours after I wake up.  Unless I wake up late, I will kill 1.5 hours every morning.  Granted, I consider my drive to work to be killed time simply because I am nowhere near fully awake and thus I drive by instinct.  Listening to commercials the entire way there is not uncommon, simply because I am not paying attention whatsoever.  Anyway, the post.
The remembered dream from last night consisted of some sort of party.  It was possibly a party for me, or just a party in general.  I believe it was a party for me since I was given a car (an Audi TT, or at least the shell of one.   Someone said the rest would be in next week.  Odd choice of car since I do not and have never wanted a TT.) and there was an interesting gag gift.  Basically, someone took all of my prized possesions, which curiously included a house, shrunk them down and locked them in a glass case for everyone to look at.  All throughout the party I never noticed this case.  Once everyone had left, it finally revealed itself and of course I tried to pry it open to retreive my things!  It was a long case, probably 12 feet long and 3 feet wide and high.  The case was in segments, each with a sealed door.  After attempting to pry each door open, the last segment contained what looked like just a piece of yellow paper.  This door opened, and out flew a few miniature (fruit fly-sized) bees!  I'm not allergic nor phobic of bees, but I am not a fan.  For some reason, my mind told me that an ex-girlfriend, Emily, had done all of this.  Made no sense!

God, come in god, god, come in god.  Damn you're a girl.  Well, I guess the reason why I'm talking to you tonight is because I've been doing a lot of thinking.  I consider mysef a pretty cool guy and I've never cheated on any of my girlfriends.  Well, except that one lil' time in Japan, but that was just head and head don't count, right?  Aww, thanks god, I knew you'd understand.  Well, I just feel like, well to be honest with you, god, I just need a sweet bitch.  Ya know, somebody not too fast, but not too slow, 'cause I dont have it all my damn self and life ain't easy.  Ya know you just want someone by your side to help smooth that thang out.  At this point, I'm not being picky, she doesn't have to have a big ol' ass, ya know.  Just something well proportioned to her body, ya know a nice lil' tail.  What, you say, you say you found somebody?  Is she cute?  So when do I get to meet her?  Aww, god, you're the greatest.  Well, I guess I'll talk to you later.  Amen.   oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, a-lady.

No, Kat, this has nothing to do with you, this is just the worlds greatest interlude.
Tis the time to start questioning my health.  Let's just say that for a past few months I've been having some odd issues for someone my age.  Just today, I had a serious headache kick in around 2:00 PM.  At first, it seemed to be another caffeine-based headache, but my caffeine intake has been quite minimal lately.  Instead of trying to fight it, I just called it a day and went home to rest.  Though I didn't feel tired until the headache kicked in and I've been getting adequate sleep, I ended up taking a 2.5 hour nap.  I'm still feeling a bit groggy.  Let's just chalk all of these problems to stress and not enough exercise (at least lately) and hope they all go away.  Ignore it; it will go away.
Procrastinating between posts requires a Herculean effort to catch up.   Sigh.
Well, last weekend I went back to Detroit for the second time in three weeks.  The main reason for going back was to attend the  urlLink auto show  and to see friends and family.  I arrived around 6 AM, rented a car, drove back to Livonia and just fell down dead in my bed.  Once noon rolled around, my aunt and I went to the Plymouth Ice Show ( urlLink image gallery ) and just hung out for a bit.  The ice sculptures cannot really be considered art, though some of the pieces showed some technical skill and creativity.  Also, art doesn't usually melt after two weeks...  It was cold enough for my body to shut down blood flow to my hands, so much so that I had difficulty using keys to get back into the car to get warm.
The rest of the evening was spent with Chris.  We hit Twelve Oaks to grab some  urlLink Panera  (they really need to open one here in Washington:  fresh and chewy breads, sharp cheeses and choice cuts of meat make a great sandwich) and then sat around his place until the Chris and Lindsay engagement party ( urlLink image gallery ) started.  It was a laid back affair consisting of wine and beer and conversation.  This was the first party I've been to with Megan, Iren and Lindsday where they didn't go on a 1.5 hour tangent about their childhood, a discussion which no one else can participate in.  No offense girls, just don't do that again!  I talked to Marty for a bit and his opening bit was classic Marty:
Ma: "Have you ever watched Twin Peaks?"
Mi: "Not really, a few episodes, but I know you are a big fan."
Ma: "So why did you go to Snoqualmie then?"
My first reaction was that this was just Marty being Marty (if you know him, you know what I mean.  Otherwise, you aren't going to meet him, so don't worry about it), and then I realized that Twin Peaks was filmed in Washington, near a waterfall and then it clicked.  I didn't feel like defending my choice to visit Snoqualmie for a non-Twin Peaks reason and Marty was just trying to show that he has been following my site.  Casey, one of the Northvillians that Chris used to hang out with every week back in high school, was also at the party.  By the eighth beer, he was becoming quite the extrovert.  He knew what he was doing, so he was enjoying the party laughing at him whilst he laughed inside.
The next morning was the auto show ( urlLink image gallery ) with my dad and grandpa.  Honestly and unfortunately, I wasn't terribly impressed with the show this year.  That shouldn't be much of a surprise since this is the first year where I've been in the actual market for a car.  Previously, I was most excited about the exotic concept cars but now I want to see vechicles that are in showrooms that I can and want to purchase.  Since I just recently purchased a car, I was looking toward the future, toward what should be my next car.  Based on the fact that the Focus is a three-year purchase, that will put my next round at the summer of 2006.  Considering that I should be able to afford a much nicer car, I was looking at the BMW M3 and the Audi S4 as possibilities.  I took many pictures of each, and got a good feel inside and out for the look of the cars.  The M3 has a terribly dated interior and it will be redesigned within the next 18 months.  The redesign could take the car in any direction, basically invalidating any observation of the current model.  The S4 has a delicious interior and the exterior styling is sedate enough yet still sporty.  While this car is a sedan, the back seat leg room is laughable at best.  With the drivers seat fully back, I could barely fit in the S4.  In contrast, I had plenty of leg room in the Infiniti G35 coupe, though head room was an issue there.  Hopefully by the time I am completely fed up with the Focus, a new car will hit my target requirements:
0-60 MPH
Mature styling, inside and out (no more thoughts of the STi or Evo)
High  urlLink build quality  (Odd, I didn't realize that Audi was so far down the list...)
Ample room for 4
More to come
I wholeheartedly recommend the Infiniti site for  urlLink car comparison .  Their tool pulls in just about every specification you need for comparing cars.
Ok, enough for one post.

God damnit, Winamp!  You were great back in the v2 days!  Then you turn into v3, a bloated, slow, mockery of a rewrite.  Oh lo', you said that v5 would be the best of v2 and the best of v3 combined!  All I get is crash after crash after crash.  DELETED!  iTunes for me for life, or until something better comes along.
UPDATE:  So I go to uninstall Winamp and the uninstall program freezes my system!  I force-reboot (no, not a Jedi power) and try again.  It takes four minutes for the uninstall UI to come up.  Once the app uninstalled, it crashed explorer (not IE), requiring another reboot.  Bah!

Anyway, after having debated for a few years in high school, I learned a few terms for debate tactics, but here is an  urlLink entire site  with terms for each fallacy.  Honestly, I must have observed all of these at one time or another.  A few are extremely frustrating because it is almost as hard to explain the fallacy as it is to fight in the debate.  Some examples are  urlLink burden of proof ,  urlLink confusing cause and effect  (seems easy to explain, just try with some people!), and  urlLink straw man .  I will admit that I have used a handful of these fallacies as well, but I usually know I am using them.  They are only used when I do not have quite enough evidence to back up my clain so I attempt to hoodwink someone with a fallacy while I think of better evidence.  If someone catches me in the fallacy, now I can give an offical term for the fallacy to show that I genuinely knew what I was doing.

I believe George Carlin said it best:
Here is my problem with the ten commandments- why exactly are there 10?
You simply do not need ten. The list of ten commandments was artificially and deliberately inflated to get it up to ten. Here's what happened:
About 5,000 years ago a bunch of religious and political hustlers got together to try to figure out how to control people and keep them in line. They knew people were basically stupid and would believe anything they were told, so they announced that God had given them some commandments, up on a mountain, when no one was around.
Well let me ask you this- when they were making this shit up, why did they pick 10? Why not 9 or 11? I'll tell you why- because 10 sound official. Ten sounds important! Ten is the basis for the decimal system, it's a decade, it's a psychologically satisfying number (the top ten, the ten most wanted, the ten best dressed). So having ten commandments was really a marketing decision! It is clearly a bullshit list. It's a political document artificially inflated to sell better. I will now show you how you can reduce the number of commandments and come up with a list that's a little more workable and logical. I am going to use the Roman Catholic version because those were the ones I was taught as a little boy.
Let's start with the first three:
I AM THE LORD THY GOD THOU SHALT NOT HAVE STRANGE GODS BEFORE ME
THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN
THOU SHALT KEEP HOLY THE SABBATH
Right off the bat the first three are pure bullshit. Sabbath day? Lord's name? strange gods? Spooky language! Designed to scare and control primitive people. In no way does superstitious nonsense like this apply to the lives of intelligent civilized humans in the 21st century. So now we're down to 7. Next:
HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER
Obedience, respect for authority. Just another name for controlling people. The truth is that obedience and respect shouldn't be automatic. They should be earned and based on the parent's performance. Some parents deserve respect, but most of them don't, period. You're down to six.
Now in the interest of logic, something religion is very uncomfortable with, we're going to jump around the list a little bit.
THOU SHALT NOT STEAL
THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS
Stealing and lying. Well actually, these two both prohibit the same kind of behavior- dishonesty. So you don't really need two you combine them and call the commandment "thou shalt not be dishonest". And suddenly you're down to 5.
And as long as we're combining I have two others that belong together:
THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTRY
THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE
Once again, these two prohibit the same type of behavior. In this case it is marital infidelity. The difference is- coveting takes place in the mind. But I don't think you should outlaw fantasizing about someone else's wife because what is a guy gonna think about when he's waxing his carrot? But, marital infidelity is a good idea so we're gonna keep this one and call it "thou shalt not be unfaithful". And suddenly we're down to four.
But when you think about it, honesty and infidelity are really part of the same overall value so, in truth, you could combine the two honesty commandments with the two fidelity commandments and give them simpler language, positive language instead of negative language and call the whole thing "thou shalt always be honest and faithful" and we're down to 3.
THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR"S GOODS
This one is just plain fuckin' stupid. Coveting your neighbor's goods is what keeps the economy going! Your neighbor gets a vibrator that plays "o come o ye faithful", and you want one too! Coveting creates jobs, so leave it alone. You throw out coveting and you're down to 2 now- the big honesty and fidelity commandment and the one we haven't talked about yet:
THOU SHALT NOT KILL
Murder. But when you think about it, religion has never really had a big problem with murder. More people have been killed in the name of god than for any other reason. All you have to do is look at Northern Ireland, Cashmire, the Inquisition, the Crusades, and the World Trade Center to see how seriously the religious folks take thou shalt not kill. The more devout they are, the more they see murder as being negotiable. It depends on who's doin the killin' and who's gettin' killed. So, with all of this in mind, I give you my revised list of the two commandments:
Thou shalt always be honest and faithful to the provider of thy nookie.
and
Thou shalt try real hard not to kill anyone, unless of course they pray to a different invisible man than you.
Two is all you need; Moses could have carried them down the hill in his fuckin' pocket. I wouldn't mind those folks in Alabama posting them on the courthouse wall, as long as they provided one additional commandment:
Thou shalt keep thy religion to thyself.

I finally moved off the Daily servers for both my email and my web hosting.  The email wasn't a big deal since Yahoo is free and I just forward everything from umich anyway.  Keep emailing me at mbibik at umich dot edu, since I might not stay with Yahoo.  The web hosting, on the other hand, was a big deal.  My gallery was taking up at least a gig and no host would charge less than $39/month for that much space.  Well, I found a free host for most of my site and then I'm hosting the galleries at home (thus the mbibik.dyndns.org URL).   No, I can't tell you where I'm hosting, but you can sort of figure it out if you are smart.
Kat and I have been up and down lately, but she is in Italy for two weeks so hopefully things will improve (absense makes the heart, blah blah blah).  Unfortunately, she had a slight hiccup with her flight plans!  Her flight from Seattle to Chicago left on time, but due to weather it couldn't land and had to circle for an extra two hours.  This made her miss the connecting flight from Chicago to Rome!  Her sister flew in from North Carolina so they could fly together to Rome so she skipped the flight to be with Kat.  Now they are both trying to find another flight to Rome.  The next direct flight that is available isn't until Saturday night and American Airlines keeps telling them to fly to London and then home for a standby flight to Rome.  No matter what, I would be very upset.   You can't really get pissed since there is no control over the weather, but very upset nontheless.
My car is really pissing me off lately.   Purchased on 06/27/2003 for about $18k and 8 months later it is only worth $10k.  I still owe about that much!  Anyway, it looks like I haven't posted about my car problems over the past few months.  My CEL (check engine light) came on during normal driving.  Nothing seemed amis, but I made a service appointment anyway.  By the time the appointment arrived, the CEL was off.  They took it and ran some tests anyway.  They replaced a fuel hose and said the car should be fine.  I took it home that night and the CEL went back on the very next day!  I waited a couple weeks before making another appointment.  During those few weeks, the CEL would go on for a couple days then go back off for awhile.  Nothing really seemed wrong with the car until I checked my fuel logs.  The car was getting 17 MPG!  This car is rated for 27 MPG, so something was definitely borked.  I took it in and this time the CEL was on when they received it.  They replaced an 02 sensor and again said the car was fine.  Well, I completely grannied the next tank of gas and got 22 MPG.  Not bad, but not good either.  I went back to my normal driving style and I'm still getting 17 MPG.  I could be driving a WRX for that sort of gas mileage!  I talked to the service tech and he claims he has seens Focii get 17 MPG and there was no solution.  Great.
I finally just decided to ignore the gas mileage since I'm not driving that much anyway.  About two weeks ago, I was simply changing a preset on my radio and it decides to completely freak out.  Now, it goes through this cycle of playing 0.5 seconds of music then turning off for 1.5 seconds, constantly rebooting.  What make its even more annoying is that you have a 0.2 second window while the radio is off to hit the power button so that it will stay off.  I'm sure I can fix it by pulling the plug (disconnect the battery), I just haven't gotten around to it.
How sad is it that my car is worth less than what I currently owe on it?   I mean, obviously that would be the case if I had just bought it or if I paid a very low down payment.   I put down $4k and the car is now 9 months old (and a 2003 model).  Gotta love almost 50% depreciation in less than a year.  Sigh.

urlLink Rockstar Games Announces Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas :   Woohoo!  Having the next GTA set in San Andreas isn't shocking since the original GTA was in three cities:   Liberty City, Vice City and San Adreas.
I still remember the day that Chris brought over his copy of GTA:3 for Joe and I to try.  He had to take it away from us a few weeks later since he was going to re-gift it, but I went right out and bought another copy.  Joe eventually traded it in for GTA:Vice City but I was never as impressed with VC.  It just didn't have the same feeling since the character that you played actually had a voice and some emotion.  I much rather enjoyed the voiceless character in 3.  Thus, I bought another copy of 3!  I just need a PS2 to go with it now...
Setting:   A Gameworks or some sort of gaming facility.  Lots of old people, dimly lit, similar to a casino in that respect.  Basically, it had the feel of a Gameworks, casino and bowling alley combined.
First scene:  I'm sitting down and playing some sort of matching game, seems like Mastermind, with quarters.  An older lady approaches from nowhere and demands to know where my gamer card is (If you have been to Gameworks or Dave & Busters, you know that instead of using quarters, you get a credit card of sorts that you can put money on.  I show a pocket full of quarters, implying that I'm just playing with quarters and she storms off.   She returns about 5 minutes later and hands me a large stack of gamer chips (4 $25, 2 $10, 2 $5, 4 $1) and a fist fill of Twizzlers.  The look she gives me as she walks off was, "I've been in your place before, kid.  Have some fun and enjoy the sugar!".  Possibly she thought I was poor since I only showed about 5 dollars with in quarters.  I vaguely remember winning a lot of money on the Mastermind game and then being given a tour of the facility.  The man in charge was giving the tour and reminded me of  urlLink Tom Poston  from the Newhart show, but with a suit that Rod Roddy would wear.   Well, a suit he would have worn, since he  urlLink died  of breast cancer.  During the tour, I remember passing by a small room in the back with mirrors on the walls and a rainbow motif adorning the ceiling.  He said that was in case anyone felt like dancing and could also be rented out.  Oddly enough, it was empty and the lights were off.  I can only imagine how those rainbows would look with the full house lights!  I know I would want to shake my groove thang, and probably go suck on a popsicle or eat some sausage.
Second scene:  The dream gets fuzzy for a bit, but I remember after the tour there was this one counter way in the back with no one around it.  The person running it is none other than Beth Manoongian, an "acquaintance" from school.  This game was a trivia game with a twist.  The questions are extremely difficult but the prize for answering a single question runs in the millions of dollars.  I decide to give it a shot, hoping that Beth will help me out a little bit.  As she pulls the question from a long box of cards, she places it on ledge face down in front of me, then gets a phone call.  While she isn't watching, I try to see what the answer is, but can't quite make it out.  It looks like "Yeh" to me backwards.  The question was something like "What is the beach on Jo Beach?".  Sort of a trick question, but I thought I already had the answer.   I hem and haw for a bit, then exclaim "Yeh!".  The answer was actually "Lev", which doesn't make sense to me in the dream or in the waking world.  Since playing the game is free, I have her pull out another card.  By this time, someone else has joined me at the counter.  This person seemed to be between 18-22 years old, male, dark hair, reminded me of a frat boy.  The next question wasn't even a question, it was something along the lines of "(SomeForeignName) is furious."  I think the riddle was that you had to figure out the country that would give out a name like that then give the translation for "furious".  The random guy and I looked at each other trying to figure it out and then I woke up.
I should rent out my brain for studies into the abnormal.
So the first inline hockey game was yesterday!   Lee and I got there 1.5 hours early so that we could sign up for the league, meet the team and do a little bit of practicing.  The facility is fairly ghetto, located in what looks like an old warehouse.  It is seperated into a little practice field for soccer, the inline rink, then a larger soccer field.  The rink itself is in good condition with an interesting plastic flooring that reminds me of the plastic used for milk crates or toddlers blocks (not the shiny kind).    We only got about 20 minutes of practice in, but it was tiring.  I know that when I got off the rink at the start of the game, I was drenched in sweat.
We ended up losing 5-4, but I scored twice and Lee scored as well!  We both received praise during and after the game which made us both feel a bit better about playing.  Everyone seems very nice and laid back which is exactly what I was hoping for.  Our first practice is tomorrow (yes, we had a game before we practiced) so hopefully my sore knee and arm feel better!

To test if new eggs were created, an ovary from a normal mouse was inplanted into a mouse that was genetically modified to generate a glowing protein in all new cells.  After transplant, eggs were observed with the glowing protein, practically confirming that new eggs are created after birth.

Ok, so my friend Alicia got hit on by a guy at a party last week, but they didn't exchange digits.  Instead, since this guy is a complete putz, asked a mutual friend for her AIM screenname!  She isn't going to date him, but they have talked a bit and she found out he has a vanity site:   urlLink Morris Singer .
Signs you are a PUTZ:
You place a picture of yourself in your title graphic.
Your site is "Under Construction":  No one with a modicum of web design ability has used "Under Construction" on their site since 1995.  Go put your crap on GeoCities.
You copy  urlLink all of your columns , and screw it up!  How many instances of "Restroom Revolution Gathers at Stonewall" are on that page?  Hard hitting journalism, at that!
Your  urlLink photo galleries  are Javascript pop-up driven garbage.
Your  urlLink bio  is written in third person perspective.
You do not have a job or a degree yet you have a  urlLink business card .
Your tagline is a warning:  "Thank you for visiting my site. Do not duplicate this information, content or design without written permission from me."
Yeah, I know, someone could rip apart my site as well, but I can take it.
Well, I just joined an inline hockey league!  We have games every Tuesday, starting tomorrow, for 12 weeks at  urlLink Arena Sports .  Lee introduced me to the team and we are both going to be on the core roster.  I was originally on the substitute list but someone from the core team dropped out.
So, I've played a lot of street hockey, but I've never played on a team or in any sort of organization fashion.  The closest I've come to organization was playing at Elbel Field in Ann Arbor where they kept a list of players.  First come, first serve, so as a person decided to take a break, the next person on the list got to hop in.  That pales in comparison to a real league, so I cannot even imagine what I'm in for tomorrow night.  I've watched enough hockey in my life to know what to do!  Right, I'll be just fine.  No worries.   I'm going to die.
Anyway, Russ and I decided that hockey is the most expensive game to play that does not require an animal (polo, cockfighting, etc).  I already owned skates and a stick, I didn't buy top of the line gear and I still spent $435 dollars.  Things I needed: helmet, elbow pads, cup, girdle, shin pads, inline pants and a hockey bag.  I better play this game for more than a season...  I'm a dork, so of course there are  urlLink pictures .
urlLink Amazon.com: Restaurants :  I'm not really sure what to make of this just yet, but Amazon now has the full menu of almost every restaurant in the greater Seattle area on their site.  Reminds me of the  urlLink monkey.org page for Ann Arbor , but Amazon has almost 800 menus to monkey's 45.
I wonder if the menus are ever updated, considering places like  urlLink Waterfront Grill  changes their menu nightly.   Well, I just checked the menu for Waterfront and it advertises an event on July 16th, 2002, so that answers the question about updates but also poses the question of how long has Amazon had this feature?  What else does Amazon offer that I have missed all this time?  I know they do  urlLink movie showtimes , oddly enough, as well.
Consumerist Whore:  So awhile back, I sold my GameCube, memory card, Metroid Prime (wanted to write "Metroit Prime", too much time spent in the Motor City, I guess), Super Mario Sunshine and Prince of Persia to GameStop for a whopping $101.  When you sell used games and consoles, they give you store credit.  This credit comes in the form of a receipt with a unique alphanumeric.  When the cashier gives you said receipt, he/she is supposed to impart the words of wisdom "DO NOT LOSE THIS."  Well, I lost it!  Luckily, I was dorky enough to write down said alphanumeric and GameSpot was able to reissue the receipt.  Let's see how long it takes before I lose it again.
Anyway, the point of this post was that I went to the mall to get the reissued receipt and ended up going shopping for myself.  I ended up buying two pairs of stain, spill and wrinkle resistant pants at the Gap and three shirts over at Express.  When I went to the get the receipt reissued, the manager said that he woudl probably call me on Tuesday with the reissue since he has to call corporate and they are closed on the weekend.  Turns out, they were open today so he told me to come pick up the receipt.  Another trip to the mall, and we all know what that means... more shopping.   I hadn't run into J. Crew or Banana Republic since I was in a bit of a rush last night.  Ended up buying my second pair of jeans, making that two pairs purchased in the past 8 months, my first pairs in at least 8 years!  J. Crew jeans are just about the only ones that fit me even close to well.  Jamie and I must have spent at least two hours looking for that first pair.  Actually, I think that only J. Crew works for jeans, Gap works for casual pants and Kenneth Cole works for dress pants.  Anyway, I ended up spending $50 for an undershirt and two pairs of boxers at Banana Republic.  Even I realize that's a waste of money, but they were cute and everyone needs underwear, right?  Mmmm,  underwear...
So my radio crapped out awhile ago, probably at least a month ago, and I just today brought it in to be fixed.  When I dropped it off, the technician sait it would be ready this afternoon.  Around 2 PM, he called to tell me that he couldn't fix it, couldn't find a replacement and had to send it out to be fixed.  He had no ETA as to when it would be back, so he said to come pick up the car.  Well, I have the car, but  urlLink no radio or CD player !
urlLink Sonics Dance Team :   Click on Tricia;   Last night, Mark Jen tried picking her up at Tap House in Bellevue.  They talked for a little while, then Tricia and her friend left.
So, by now you have probably heard that Nintendo's next handheld will have two screens and be called the DS (D = Dual/Double S = Screen). Take a look at this  urlLink mockup  posted to Gizmodo.  The angled design immediately screams to me "This is better because it is different!", but just think about the ergnomics.  Hold your hands in front of you as if you were trying to hold something a bit smaller than a paperback book, lengthways.  You don't curl your wrists outward and your fingers upward, as you would have to with this design.  I can see a large number of young gamers developing carpal tunnel if this design got the green light.  (I'm going to refrain from jokes about other causes of carpal tunnel in young male gamers.)
A common question about the Pocket PC Phone that I carry around is "Can it play games?"  Well, the answer is yes, but why bother?  The overall form factor is wrong, requiring you to interlace your fingers to hold the device with two hands.  Additionally, there is a directional pad and four buttons, but the pad only supports the four cardinal directions (not diagonals) and two of the buttons are toward the top of the screen.  Basically, I wouldn't even try playing pong on this thing.  Hell, I have nethack install on it and even that is impossible to play.
"2 + 2 = 5 for large values of 2.", why do I find that so humorous?
urlLink Penny Arcade! :   By far, the best description of those self-cleaning litter boxes.  Quotes of Note:  "the tiny pot roasts my cat leaves behind", "sometimes it is flung out, as through by catapult, toward imaginary foes", and "It is the sort of thing you would design if you had only a vague description of a cat and you didn't really give a fuck if it worked or not."
In response to my away message:  "Why do all girls have the crazy?":
Lee (11:35:43 PM): i think girls impact male productivity more than disease
Jenn (8:34:51 AM): you sure know how to pick 'em
Meg (6:36:39 AM): I'll admit to having the crazy :-)
Krista's away message: I like Mike's away message "why do all girls have the crazy"
Woohoo, go  urlLink Markko !  He only one a single stage of the entire rally, but "slow and steady wins the race".  Ok, in all actuality, having your strongest competitor get slapped with a  urlLink 5 minute penalty  wins the race.  If you don't want to read the link, basically Petter Solberg had some electrical issues before the start of a stage.  He and his codriver tried to push the car uphill to make it to the starting line in time.  There were already 4 minutes late, giving them a 40 second penalty when the officials realized they received help from the spectators to reach the starting line.  That tacked on an additional 5 minute penalty eventhough neither the driver nor codriver asked for the help.  With a final time difference of 3 minutes and 14.7 seconds from Markko Martin, Solberg would have won.  As Russ said, he probably wouldn't have pushed so hard if it wasn't for that 5 minute and 40 second penalty.
Why am I cooler than you?  Thanks for asking!  Well, do you have the Knight Rider theme song as your ringtone?  Nope, didn't think so.
Dream Update:  The dream from last night concerned me entering some sort of car show.  The show was held in a building similar to Cobo Hall where the North American International Auto Show is held.  The first part of the dream is quite fuzzy, but it involved Jeff, Russ and I driving quite a long distance from home to the show, trailering my show car.  The car was a fairly sedate blue; brighter than Ford Racing blue but not as bright as Subaru World Rally blue.  I have no idea what type of car it was, though my mind told me it was an Acura RSX.  I'm not even sure what sort of car show it was, but I knew that I had to perform something.  Possibly just drive it around for show, possibly drag race it, possibly drift it, who knows!
After we got to the show, there was quite a bit of time before I had to drive, so we walked around.  As we walked around, I realized that I had forgotten the keys to the show car!  Since it was trailered there, I didn't need the keys.  Oddly enough, I found out that I was carrying one of my old keys from the Michigan Daily and it worked as a master key for the entire showroom building.  Again, oddly enough, all of the mens bathrooms were closed so all of the womens bathrooms became co-ed.    While Jeff, Russ and I were walking back down to the parking garage so that we could go get the keys to the show car, we ran into a group of about six people.  We were in a small hallway at a bend, so it was a tight fit to get all 9 people through.  The groups sort of collided, then the six people swarmed us.  My first thought was to check our wallets.  They didn't actually steal our wallets, but Jeff had lost all of his IDs and all of his money except for singles.  Just at the end of the altercation, I some how stole back all of Jeff's IDs and a huge stack of money.  I checked my wallet at this point, and it actually had more money in it than before!  At first, I was pleased, then I checked the bills.  A 300 hundred dollar bill?  Another bill that had multiple denominations on it (I remember one that had "$300", "$133" and "$16" all on the same bill)?  Another bill that had some sort of religious message on the back instead of a visual scene?  This was where I woke up.
Ok, ok, I know that WAPCE is not a terribly common acronym, but since when did DTB become common!?  Christ.

I am absolutely amazed by this  urlLink review  of Dawn of the Dead.  Not because it is a bad review, not because it is a funny review, not because the review is dramatically wrong but because this is a review for parents.  This is one of the most gore-filled movies I have ever seen, lots of swearing, some nudity and sexual situations and all of the other great things that give movies an R rating.  There is even a handy table listing issues such as "Profanity", "Nudity/Sex" and even "Diversity Issues."  You would figure that the review would be horribly opposed to anyone young seeing this and especially not making this family affair.  Au contrair, the review is suprisingly positive without a lick of conservative America "hide your children from this filth" opinion.  The review even gives discussion topics if this movie is seen as a family!  "Families who watch this movie might wish to discuss the different approaches taken by the survivors and the range of choices that they make. Are there times when the moral answer is at odds with the instinct to survive? How would you handle this variance?"  I am amazed, and quite proud, of this site.
I knew the addiction wasn't going to get any better when I would think back to those lovely days when I owned a video game console.  All those levels beat, all those new trophies acquired, all those end-bosses defeated...   I needed a console, and fast!  I ended up using my $101 store credit at GameStop to buy a refurbished PS2 with network adapter and another copy of Gran Turismo 3.  I still had my saved game from when Joe and I co-owned a PS2, so I fired that up.
Last night, I ended up beating all of the rally levels.  I used the same car for all of the levels:  a heavily modified Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII GSR, putting out about 542 HP.  There are 10 tracks on the rally circuit, 3 races per track and 2, 3 and 5 laps per race.  That means 300 rally laps to complete the entire circuit.  My car couldn't handle as well as most of the rally cars on gravel, but the sheer power got it through those tracks without fault.  On tarmac, the car could handle at least as well as the rally cars and I still had a huge power advantage.  The prize for getting all first places on the 30 different races is the  urlLink Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Version .  You'd think a Suzuki would be a horrible prize car, but mine is currently modified to put down 1881 HP!  Top speed is currently 278.9 MPH, nice.
I am genuinely curious to know, on average, how many people a person knows (basically friends and family) that have committed suicide?  Personally, I believe I only know of one person.  I say believe because I have a very good ability to block out many harmful events.  I only know of one person that committed suicide at my high school during the four years I was there and I didn't actually know the person, so they aren't on my list.  There was a discussion I saw online and some people knew upwards of nine people that had ended their lives.  I guess that high of a number just made me think.  I'm still thinking.
Car hunt update:  I got to ride along on two test drives today.  I say ride along since I had Jeff drive them for me!  I suck at manual so I didn't feel like embarrassing myself.  First was the '89 Mitsubishi Colt.  The exterior was decent with just a few bit of rust along the faded paint.  The interior, on the other hand, was well aged.  Not well aged like a wine, cheese, or whiskey, but well aged like that a high school cafeteria mom.  Bits of plastic were broken in just about every spot, including the turn indicator.  It was so broken that Jeff could barely get it to work at all.  The engine was in pretty good shape, but the clutch was really soft.
Next up was the '92 Camaro.  The owner was about 10 minutes late, but all was forgiven when I saw the quality of this car.  There is a slight dent just behind the driver side door that is starting to rust and there is a modicum of rust above the rear passenger wheel well.  Other than that, the vehicle looked practically new!  The interior was a bit worn, but no damage.  The clutch was in good shape, the stereo is brand new, the tires are new, the battery is new and most of the suspension was new.  Needless to say, I was pretty impressed.  It was only an RS, which means that it has 140 HP but 180 lb-ft of torque (and still better than the 130 HP and 135 lb-ft in my Focus!).  Since the car is in such good shape, I really doubt that I will be able to talk him down from the $2,000 price.
Considering how impressed I was with the car, I called up my insurance agent.  If I add a second car to my policy, it will drop the price on the Focus from $672 to $637.  Full coverage on the Camaro would be $298 and just the basics will get run me $198.  Not that bad at all!  I was originally considering paying for a parking spot in a lot near my apartment, but then I realized that I should be able to park at work.  As long as I swap cars at least once a week and move the cars around every other day, I shouldn't get in trouble from security.  As soon as they say something, I will pay for the lot ($50/month).
If I don't think of anything I've forgotten and no one else says this is a dumb idea, I think I'm going to buy it on Monday.  I'd love to have it for the weekend, especially while Kat is gone, but I really shouldn't make a rash decision.
The fourth FloorBurn game was last night.  We improved our record to 2-2!  Lee and I were back on a line again, but we just weren't in sync.  I was playing too far away from him and he wasn't able to get the puck up to me.  No matter what, I stole the puck deep in their end, deked the goalie and got my fourth goal of the season.  We ended up winning 4-1 and team morale was much higher than any other night.  It's possible that our practice last week really did help, but we shall see.
Ok, more updates to the use car hunt.  I totally forgot that Microsoft has its own classified ads!  I have contacted four more sellers and I already have two replies!  I cannot link to the cars since they are on an internal site, but I can tell you that one is a '92 Camaro and the other is an '83 Supra!  It would be cool to say that I owned a Supra, no matter what model year it is.  Both are in fairly decent shape, at least from what I was told.  The Supra needs a muffler, but that can't be more than $200 to replace.  I should be able to test drive both of them this week.  Maybe I will end up buying a car this week!
I'm looking for a used car!  No, even with all of the problems with the Focus, (which I've since named Sanchez, since the car was made in Mexico and now I can make all sorts of "Dirty Sanchez" jokes) I am not thinking of replacing it for a used car.  I'm actually looking for an old manual car so that I can get better with an MT before I get a real car.  I figure, why not spend upwards of $2,000 on a used car, practice driving a manual, then sell it off for upwards of $1,500 rather than spending $1,200 on clutch replacement for a new car?  There is a parking lot a block away from my apartment where I can get a space for only $50/month.  I will put the least amount of insurance on it, so it shouldn't be too expensive of a proposition.
Here are the cars I've shown an interest in so far:

I purchased my  urlLink hockey skates  (image) last year when Eric and I decided to get back into inline hockey.  The wheels that the skates came with weren't bad (Labeda Shooters) and the bearings were satisfactory (ABEC 3 rated, the lowest rating but there are worse bearings out there that aren't even rated!).  I had used the wheels quite a bit playing outdoor inline, so they were quite worn down:
urlLink
The first two games of the indoor inline season were played on those wheels.  Needless to say, I fell a handful of times.  It took a few weeks of online bargain hunting, but finally I picked up a new set of wheels and bearings.
Out with the old:

Dream from last night:  I cannot remember the bulk of the dream, but it involved a large number of my friends from both Microsoft and UMich at a presentation of some sort.  Everyone was sitting in rows of chairs waiting for it to start.  I was supposed to drive to this with one of the devs on my team, Matt, but when I got there, he was sitting with Matt Weber.  Just before the presentation started, I remember that I borrowed Jeff's can opener and he needed it back!  I was quite concerned since this was a limited edition can opener.  Oddly enough, there were shelves and shelves of shoe boxes and skiing equipment to the side of the presentation room.  After a frantic search, I finally found the can opener at the bottom of a shoe box.  The can opener was a WRX model in Sonic Yellow, which would explain why I was frantic to find it (the Impreza WRX in Sonic Yellow is a very rare sight).  That doesn't explain why I am having crazy dreams.
FloorBurn improved to a record of 3-2 after our 6-2 win on Tuesday.  I scored twice, so I'm back as leading scorer.
Wall of Meat (flag football) is perfect so far at 2-0!  We had a come from behind win on Saturday with our new quarterback, but I can definitely see the team improving from here out.
I'm getting closer to buying the Camaro.  The owner just needs to get it to pass emissions and then I will almost certainly buy it.
The NY auto show is tomorrow thus I expect information about the 2005 Subarus to be released tomorrow.  Rumor has it that the WRX will go a complete redesign for the '06 model year, so maybe buying an '05 would be silly.  I don't want to look dated that fast!

I can't believe I forgot to post this!  So every three months, the  urlLink Puget Sound Blood Center  sends a Bloodmobile to my campus.  I made an appointment for the first time it came around, but had to cancel it due to a meeting conflict.  The second time it came around, I went to donate without an appointment and they were full.  Finally, I got to donate yesterday.
Since it was my first time donating with them, I had to go through the full screening process, mini interview and all.  Finally, I give blood and they have me lay down for an extra a few minutes afterward since this was my first time with them and all.  The actual process of giving blood went just fine.  As I was laying down resting, my stomach started to feel a bit nauseous.  Suddenly, the nausea got worse and I started to think about asking one of the nurses for something to vomit into.  The next thing I notice, there are three people crowded around me and I've got cold compresses on my neck and chest.  Turns out, I passed out!  I was only out for a few seconds, but it was not a pleasant experience.  Soon after I woke up, I broke out in a cold sweat.  I felt functional about 5 minutes later, but I was definitely tired and out of it for the rest of the day.  I, obviously, skipped my hockey game.
I'm sorry folks, this one just speaks for itself.  David Hasselhoff is going to be making a  urlLink Knight Rider movie , possibly with Ben Affleck playing his son.   I'm so there on opening night.
Katherine and I went to Daniel's Broiler on Lake Union on Thursday night.  We had a $25 gift certificate, but that really doesn't go very far when the entrees are about $40 each!  The hostess treated us just like any other couple having dinner on a Thursday night, but the waiter had a different idea.  It seems that he saw two kids that were in over their heads and thus he didn't expect a large tip.  Since, in his mind, his tip was already shot, he decided to basically treat us like an annoyance.  Since I was out for a nice dinner, I ordered Perrier to start and I made Kat get some Evian even though she is a tap water kind of girl.  He brought us two glasses and two bottles and didn't even offer to pour for us.  I know, I'm getting prissy here, but come on.  While every other table received warm bread and butter before the meal, I had to specifically request it.  When it finally came, our food was ready not 2 minutes later.  When we ordered wine, he acted as if the only grape product we had ever drank was Welch's.  Thanks buddy, I know the basics of wine, and yes I do know that higher altitude wines come from a more concentrated grape.  He got most of our order correct, but he switched how Katherine and I liked our meat (I ordered medium and she ordered medium-rare and he switched them).  Kat has eaten at Daniel's probably ten times and she said this was the first time they didn't offer to cut the meat at the table to show that it was cooked properly.  Maybe he knew he had messed up.  No matter what, our waiter was still not the most annoying part of the evening!
Soon after we had sat down, a pair of gentlemen were seated directly behind us.  Our backs were mostly turned to them, but Kat could tell that the older of the two, maybe 45-50 years old, was consistently staring at her.  This skeeved her out a bit, but was soon ignored.  After we had finished our entree and started to dig into some creme brulee, our waiter approached carrying two glasses of red wine.  He informed us that the man behind us offered two glasses of his fine Argentinean wine.  We raised our glasses and turned to the man and thanked him.  He said "Enjoy, or as we would say in Norway, Skord."  At this point, we felt fairly awkward.  Here was two men that had offered us nice wine and now expected us to at least talk to them.  I basically told Kat to hurry up and drink the wine so we could say a quick word with them and then get the hell out of there!  Kat didn't want to gulp the wine, figuring that would be even more rude.  Eventually, we started to talk to them while we were all still seated.  He asked if we were here on business and when I replied in the negative, he said "Yes, you two look too romantic for business."  The older man was doing all the talking and when he informed me that his companion was visiting from Norway, I just assumed that he couldn't speak English very well.  The older man then complemented Kat on her looks and said something about us being an attractive couple.  Kat and were both obviously nervous and annoyed, but we were still stuck talking.  The man finally said something about his wife and then started babbling.  I couldn't understand a word he was saying and Katherine was having trouble hearing, so we basically turned back to our table to finish the wine and escape.  After drinking the last drop, we got up to leave and I approached the man to at least shake his hand.  After shaking, he gently held on to my hand and placed his other hand on my upper arm, basically trapping me there.  He asked if we enjoyed the wine, if we would like to sit down and have another glass.  I told him we had to leave and we basically fled.  At this point, I heard his companion speak and he said something in accent-free English.  He understood the language, he was just being quiet because he was obviously embarrassed by what was going on!  Kat was, understandbly, a bit disturbed by the whole situation.  Ugh.
Okay, okay.  At first, I wasn't going to post anything more about the Elise since it is simply not practical at all, it's $40k and all of the models allocated for this year are already sold out, but this  urlLink review  just takes the cake.  Such pithy quotes as "It\92s a prescription for disaster for those of us with acrylic nails." and "It will not disappoint its audience \97 'newly divorced men who are looking for a new wife,'".  I still want one, damnit.
Bwahaha, I have a  urlLink GMail  account!   It's not vaporware after all!   How did I get an account, you ask?  Well, it involves Blogger...   That's all I'm going to say.
I've added a few pictures to my  urlLink moblogging gallery  including one of my  urlLink odometer in binary .  That would be 18 miles total and 6.5 on the trip in decimal.
Cars I would consider buying at this point in my life:
Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution
Subaru Impreza WRX STi
Pontiac Solstice (unreleased)
Honda S2000
Mazda Mazdaspeed Miata
BMW M Coupe (no longer offered)
Infiniti G35 Coupe
It's a shame that I do not feel terribly strong about any of them.
Speaking of cars, I totally forgot to say that I officially own the Camaro now!  I took a few  urlLink crappy pictures ; I will try to get some better ones in the sun soon.  So far, I've only driven the car in the parking garage at work and a few blocks around my building.  I am still pretty horrible with the manual, but I'm getting better.
Last night, Jeff and I took it out for a little spin.  Everything was going fine until I stopped at a stop sign and just couldn't seem to get the car going.  I kept stalling and stalling and stalling.  It felt very weird to me since I was giving it a ton of gas, it just didn't seem like enough.  After about 12 tries I finally got the car going!  It still seemed to be acting up because the revs were so low.  I stopped at the next stop sign and had the same issue!  Finally Jeff hopped in, played with the shifter and turns out, I was in third gear!  I'm just surprised that I actually got it to go that one time.  Oh well, Jeff said the shifter is fairly narrow and thus it's hard to tell which gear you are in.  I just think I am dumb and that is one more thing I will pay attention to when driving stick.
The more I read about the Pontiac Solstice, the more I like it.  Take  urlLink this article  from Autoweek.  They get to test drive a few engineering mules and were quite impressed.  If the car is impressive in 85% complete form and Lutz is driving this home as the most important GM project, the final result is going to be amazing.
UPDATE:  The car may only have 170 HP, but it also have 170 lb-ft in comparison to the 142 HP and 125 lb-ft found in a base Miata.   Even the new Mazdaspeed version only has 178 hp and 166 lb-ft.
While Jeff and I were at the movies tonight, a lady dropped a large handful of change while at the consession stand.  It was at least 50 coins, so I immediately bent down to help her pick it up.  She was a bit older, so she let me pick it all up.  Her husband must have been at the bathroom, because he showed up just as I finished.  They both thanked me and started to walk off.  Just then, I got a good look at her husband.  Turns out, it was Lenny Wilkins!  Quote from NBA.com about  urlLink Lenny :  "Lenny and his wife Marilyn have three children, Leesha, Randy and Jaime, and two grandchildren, Ashley and Nicole. They make their off-season home in Seattle."  Pretty cool.
Sorry everyone, the GMail accounts are gone!
My take on GMail.
Ok, I've only been using it for a short while, but I haven't quite gotten the hang of it yet.  The first issue is that all email is sorted by "conversations", which is basically what everyone but Microsoft and GMail call threads.  For those of you that don't know what that means, a thread/conversation is just what it sounds like, a collection of email messages relating to a specific topic.  On the most basic level, a conversation is an original message and any replies to that message.  Certain mail clients assign a thread ID and thus you can change the message subject and it will still be a part of the original thread/conversation.  Either GMail or Yahoo doesn't support thread ID because I changed the subject on a thread and GMail started a new "conversation".
There are a ton of keyboard shortcuts, which is interesting for a webmail client.  Seeing as I used pine for my email for 6 years, I'm quite used to navigating my email with a keyboard...  in pine!  Using it in gmail isn't as easy as I expected.  There are keyboard shortcuts for navigating various messages and conversations, but very basic actions, like cancelling the composition of a message, has to be done by mouse.  I do love that the keyboard shortcut for reporting spam is the excalamation key...  it just goes so well with most spam: "Ge.t a m.a$siv3 mem.b3r! buttercup obtuse bingo cxoiuqweijfd4klhjd7"  My natural response is "!".
GMail has a concept of "All mail" and "archive".  The main action for all emails is to "archive" it.  It doesn't place the message in the trash, it doesn't move it to a specific folder, it just moves the email out of your inbox.  The only way to view archived mails is to use the All Mail view.  All Mail shows any mail in your inbox, your sent mail "folder" and anything you have archived.  It does not show any spam or trash emails.
Instead of supporting folders like most email clients (web or desktop), GMail has introduced the concept of "Labels".  Well, I shouldn't say introduced, but this is the first time I've seen it in relation to an email client.  Instead of storing a conversation (see above) in various default or unique folders, you can assign one or more labels to the conversation.  Let's say that you wanted to save all conversations from a specific person in a specific folder and you wanted to save all conversations about a specific topic in a specific folder, what happens if your specifics collide?  Do you try to decide which folder takes presidence?  With labels, you can give the conversation labels for both the sender and the topic.  Like most folder views, there is a list of labels so you can jump to the list of all conversations with a specific label.
GMail also supports filters which works hand in hand with labels.  You can filter on sender, receiver, subject, words in the body and words missing from the body.  The actions you can take are skip inbox (meaning it places the mail into the archive (see above)), apply a specific label or move it directly to the trash.  You cannot mark anything as spam through the filter.
One little feature that I saw in their help files but they did not actually implement related to attachments.  Instead of showing the common and generic paper clip icon to denote an attachment, GMail would use an icon to represent the file type of the attachment.  If it was a PDF, the common PDF icon would be used, etc.  I tested this out, and it's just a paper clip.  Shucky darn.
Overall, I'm sure that I will get used to conversation view, labels and archive and be very happy with my free 1000 MB webmail client harnessing Google!
Do you want to try out GMail?  Since GMail is still in a test period, acceptance is by invitation only.  I received my invitation through Blogger, but now that I am a user I can invite two more people!  The first two to contact me get dibs.  (Note:  If you ask via email, I only check once a day and thus it would be faster to txt/IM/call me.  If you email me right away yet I get two phone calls after your email was sent, you ain't getting GMail from me.)
Wow, some guys just have it rough.  For whatever reason, 107.7 The End in Seattle took Andy Savage off their morning show.  I could probably look it up, but I really don't have the patience right now.  For a couple months after that, they would play hour-long themed blocks of music:  80s punk, new wave, grunge, etc.  Finally, they brought in Marconi and Tiny for the morning program.  About a month after that, The End changed formats and  dropped  them.  Sucks!
At the time, they were on two radio stations, The End and a station in "Porkland" (their infantile name for Portland).  Well, looks like they got  urlLink booted from Portland  as well for joking about the Berg beheading.  D'oh!

Angry Cell Phone Customer Trashes Verizon Store
POSTED: 11:43 a.m. EDT May 14, 2004
FARGO, N.D. -- A man who said he was fed up with his cellular phone service went to a Fargo mall and started hurling phones across a store, striking an employee and causing more than $2,000 in damage, authorities said.
Jason Perala, 22, of Fargo, told The Forum newspaper that he planned only to yell at employees at Verizon Wireless.
"Then I just lost it," he said. "I just started grabbing computers and phones and throwing them. I just destroyed the place. ... I kind of regret that I did it, but I hope my message got across."
Police said Perala took off his shirt and put on safety glasses before throwing around computers, phones and other items.
One employee was struck in the shoulder by a phone before he and other workers dashed into an office, locked the door and called police, Sgt. Kevin Volrath said. Other businesses in the West Acres mall lowered their steel security gates during Thursday's incident.
Perala was arrested without incident and jailed on charges of felony criminal mischief and misdemeanor simple assault.

urlLink Karamazov : "He also discusses his belief that men only practice love for their fellow man out of a belief in God and the immortality of their soul. If they did not believe, Ivan says, than there would exist no incentive or reason for them to practice love and kindness. If they do not believe, then the only motive for action would logically be self-interest. "
Is that a truism?  Do you believe that, in a mentality lacking love and kindness, the only logical conclusion would be that all actions would be driven by self-interest?  The implication here is that self-interest is inherently a negative characteristic.  Is it not possible that, while looking out for yourself, you can also look out for others?  The man that helps and cares for others may draw greater fortune to himself.  By looking out for others, you are in a way looking out for yourself?
Honestly, there is very little that I do that does not benefit myself in some way.  I doubt there have been more than two cases in the past five years where I have done something that I did not think would ultimately benefit myself.  If I make a sacrifice at work to help someone out, I believe that this action will be remembered and either they would help me out or I would gain better standing in their mind.  If I was to perform community service, it would partially be because I could talk about it later and have others think highly of me.  I'm selfish, but sometimes it benefits others.
Gah, I can't believe I forgot to post this earlier!  So, on Monday, I had a cashier ask me about my age.  Well, it happened again on Thursday!  I was going to Sports Authority to buy an ankle brace for Kat when it happened.  I picked out the brace and headed to the first available cashier.  I paid with a credit card and had to use one of the electronic signature readers.  She told me to keep my card out for signature validation so I also pulled out my drivers license.  My signature never looks right on this electronic devices so I did it just in case.  I guess the cashier looked at my birthdate because when she handed my cards back to me:
"Are you 23, 24?"
"23, why, do I seem older, younger?"
"More mature."
"Any reason?"
I'm 21 and guys our age seem younger.  You dress well, like you made it somewhere, you seem established."
The funny thing is, I was wearing a long-sleeve jersey material shirt (Kenneth Cole, but she couldn't tell that), Gap slacks and black Puma sneakers!  I definitely wasn't sporting "mature" looking attire.  Oh well.
Woohoo, I donated $10 to  urlLink MusicBrainz  today.  Horrible name but great service.  You feed it an MP3 and it spits back out the correct Artist, album, genre, etc and resaves the file with the correct information automatically.  Totally free but also totally worth a $10 donation.
urlLink CNN.com - Three children found decapitated in apartment - May 27, 2004 :  I don't really know how to comment on this situation.  A mother returns to find her three children decapitated.  The only possible reason I can think of is some sort of debt that went unpaid.

My brain is triggered to wake up if I hear a diesel engine idling outside of my window.  Why?  Well, back in senior year, I was sharing a parking permit with a roommate.  I was almost towed twice for parking in my apartment lot without the permit but I heard the idling tow truck and woke up!  Anyway, there was a truck idling outside of my apartment this morning around 7 AM and thus I woke up.
I really shouldn't be posting right now as I should be working on the SEVEN specifications I have to write in the next few weeks.  I'd tell you more, but then I'd have to make the internet sign an NDA and I just don't have time for the paperwork this week.
Anyway, during the daily Jeff-and-Mike lunch extravaganza, something a bit humorous happened.  Jeff and I have a pretty set list of restaurants we go to (Quizno's, Qdoba, Chipotle, Ribeye, Nasai Teriyaki, Red Robin, Matt's Famous, Arby's, Taj Palace, Yen Ching, etc) and some of the places have started to remember us.  Today at one of the usuals, my order number was 29.  The cashier said "29, close to 30...   are you over 30?".  I had remembered from a previous conversation that she said she had been out of school for 10 years and just got her degree last year so I assumed she was about 30 though she looked not a day over 21.  My response was "No, a bit lower", giving her a thumbs down motion.
"29?"
"No."
"27?"
"Nope, lower."
At this point, she just looked at me, scared to give another incorrect answer.  I held up two fingers, said "23" and transitioned to three fingers.  She was quite flabergasted and made some commented about how I looked so much older while she looked so much younger saying that people don't think of her as a day older than 20, 19 even!

Haha, I'm a tool.  Just today, Kat and I went to Big Apple Bagels to grab a quick lunch before we both headed off to work (yes, working on a Saturday).  I ordered my usual, a Roma Italian sub and a 32oz Diet Coke.  We were both a bit tired today but I believe I was the one with worse coordiation.  While reaching for my drink, I slightly nudged it.  Thinking I was about to knock it off the table, I made a quick grab for it, hoping to save it.  Instead, I increased the drinks velocity and redirected its destination vector directly toward Kat.  Needless to say, I absolutely drenched her in 32oz of Diet Coke.  Thankfully, she wasn't too upset.  I tried to clean up as best I could, but she was basically covered and nothing could be done.  We quickly finished our meal outside and then went home.  Minus 50 points for me (for the obvious) and plus 50 points for her (or not freaking out).
Found on Fark!   urlLink retroCRUSH: The 50 Coolest Song Parts :  I don't agree with many of the selections (either that or it's just hard to tell from the much-needed but low quality MP3 clips they give you) but over all this is a pretty cool list with some of my favorites.   Favorites include anything by Queen, The Who and Heart.
urlLink What was Number 1 on the day you were born???? :  I remember seeing this site years ago but I don't think I ever blogged it.  Here are some songs:
Mine:   Magic  by Olivia Newton-John
Kat's:  Pop Muzik  by M
Jenn's:  Funkytown  by Lipps, Inc.   (bwahahaha)
Just for kicks, the song 9 months before my birthdate was  No More Tears (Enough is Enough)  by Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer.  Hmm, not sure what to make of that one.
Oh, BTW, my gallery is hosed.  I'm not exactly sure when it happened or what happened, but it's hosed.  I tried to upload some pictures last night and my upload tool kept crashing.  I tried to add the pictures through the normal web interface and that was having some problems.  When I couldn't delete some albums, that's when I knew it was completely messed up.  Even upgrading over the existing installation didn't help.
Looks like I get to rebuild it from scratch this weekend!  Yay!

Hmm, power to weight ratios, one of the most important aspects of any car.  The Focus only has 130 HP but it only weighs 2551 pounds and has 135 ft-lbs.  The Camaro, on the other hand has only 140 HP and weighs 3103 pounds but has 180 ft-lbs.  A few calculations later give 19.62 pounds-per-HP and 18.90 pounds-per-ft-lb for the Focus and 22.16 pounds-per-HP and 17.24 pounds-per-ft-lb for the Camaro.  The Focus is faster than the Camaro but the Camaro has better low-end acceleration?  Weird.
Now that Russell is moving out and I do not have a roommate yet, my rent goes from $672.50 a month to $1570 a month!  I get to pay $95 a month for the right to a second parking space when I do find a roommate.  I also get the fun of trying to find said roommate which is becoming harder than I expected.  Thanks!
All of the second round of GMail invites are gone!  Try  urlLink Gmail Swap .
Nothing quite like slogging through an array of websites to find out the recommended fuel for your new crappy car.  Considering that the car was produced in 1992, trying to find information about it online is interesting.  Most of the sites that have info are either all-encompasing sites that cover a certain aspect of all cars (safety info, for example), or they are some enthusiast site just for that car or type of car (thus a third generation Camaro).  I finally found that my base V6 engine only requires regular unleaded fuel.  I know the Chevy used to have a 4-cyl Camaro and that would obviously take regular so I figured it was possible that the V6 was mapped for midgrade (89 octane).  Nope, just 87 octane.

As a kid, I absolutely hated a warm pillow.  I would have difficulty falling asleep because by the time I had rested enough to almost fall asleep, the heat of my pillow would annoy me and wake me up.  I would either flip the pillow or sleep on the other end.  In other words, the average pillow had four sectors.  By the time I was done with all four, the original sector had probably cooled down to normal and I could switch to it.  I remember being awake for at least an extra hour some nights because of this.
I no longer have this problem, otherwise I would run out and buy the  urlLink Chillow !  A small, flat but otherwise pillow-shaped insert, the Chillow acts as a heatsink and radiator.  It makes one side cold and one side a bit warm.  The warmth is absorbed by the pillow proper and dissipated leaving the surface nice and chilly.  Hell, I might buy one anyway!

Car update:  I'm getting better at the manual seeing as I haven't stalled yet today (a first!).  I've had some compliments including about the exhaust note.  I'm happy.  I'm really started to get used to the upgraded audio.  The bass response is pretty cool and there is a fairly slick steering column (not steering wheel) based audio controller.  I will probably take a picture of it when I do a full photoshoot later.  Basically, it is stalk sticking out from the lower left area of the steering column.  It has a two-way switch for station seeking (while in radio mode) and track seeking (for CD mode), two buttons for volume control and a single button for mode which will switch between presets for radio mode and will switch CDs for CD mode.  I'm getting used to using it.
Yesterday was my one year anniversary at Microsoft!  Following standard procedure, I brought in a pound of M&Ms.  Against standard procedure, I actually brought in a pound of M&Ms in three different flavors (plain, peanut and crispy (which is crispy in the sense of Nestle Crunch bars: crisped rice)).  It feels fairly odd that I've already been here for a year.  I've done so much, but it also seems like I could have accomplished more.  I shouldn't really complain, there are others that started around the same time I did that haven't done much at all.
There are actually a few people that have started recently (one started two years ago and two others started a year ago) that are leaving the company.  One is getting married, another is going to school and another is starting a company.  It should be publicly known, but Microsoft is reducing their benefits.  It just looks like there isn't enough to keep people around anymore.

Jeff took a look at my comparison post and asked about the units for the slalom course.  I knew it was MPH but Jeff reasoned that time through the course might be a better value to track.  I figured that average speed was used because different cars will have different acceleration rates, times through the course, speeds and more.  Just using time might be a better indication of cornering ability and power, not just cornering ability.  Anyway, I found this in one of my Motor Trend articles:
Just drive around the cones as fast as your can, right?  Yes-and no.  Try cracking off six perfect, consecutive, emergency lane-changes at freeway speeds (some well above) with a margin of error at less than one inch.  Sure, this sound challenging until one realizes each cone arrives at less than a one second interval-the whole thing takes less than six seconds in these vehicles.  This is one test that best reveals a car's evil side.  A propensity to push, get loose, or even spin is ever more apparent while all four ties are howling at, in some cases, 80 MPH.  That's right, the speeds listed above are timed averages between the entry and exit markers along the 600-foot course-not how fast the car is actually traveling along its curvy line, which is, in fact, much faster.
As you can tell from my last post, I have a new car!  Well, almost new.  Let me tell the story.
About this time last year, I was car shopping.  I had almost signed on an Evo when better judgment told me to go with something cheaper to start.  Also, 271 HP is a bit much for someone that had never driven a manual before.  I decided to use my grandfathers Ford discount and just pick up a Focus.  It had decent looks and handling and the interior was fairly accomodating.  I have yet to find nicer seats (not even in the SVT).  While I was trying to pick out the Focus I wanted, the sales person I was working with kept mentioning the SVT.  When we finally went out to the dealer lot to grab an automatic ZX3 for a test drive, we had to pass over at least five SVTs to find a single ZX3.  Obviously the cars were not selling well.
I bought the Camaro about two months ago and I've only put about 200 miles on it.  I wasn't getting any better at the manual, so I just stopped trying.  I'm always looking at car forums when the SVT was mentioned.  I cannot remember the context but someone was praising it on a Subaru forum.  A car has to be at least moderately respectable for someone entrenched in another manufacturer's camp to praise it.  Just on a whim, I decided to look up new/used SVTs in the area.  The only one I could find was a 2004 model with about 940 miles on it.  I figured that had to be a typo for 9,400 so I figured I'd email the dealer.  Nope, not a typo.  An older gentleman traded in a SVT Lightning for an SVT Focus and then decided it seemed too young for him.  He returned it 3 weeks later.
They gave me an overnight test drive and I decided this is what my car should have been all along.  Tighter (but not punishing) suspension, better brakes, better looks, better acceleration and an amazing transmission.  Going to this car from the Camaro is very eye-opening.  The Getrag trans is just a thing of beauty.  I think the only better transmission out there for under $35k is in the S2000.  The dealership first put the car on the market at $19,995 (or just about what the car cost new) and that didn't fly.  The salesperson also offered me only $7,500 for the ZX3 and an interest rate of 7.49%.  Given those numbers, my monthly payment would have been $677.17!  The price of the car was talked down to $17,500 then $16,900 and finally $16,500.  The trade in on the ZX3 was brought up to $7,750 then $8,000 then $8,500.  The APR was brought down to 6.49%.  After the trade-in, loan payoff (of the ZX3), license, document fees (yeah WTF), taxes and $1,000 down, I had to finance $17,238.75.  With an APR of 6.49%, my monthly payment will only be $528.27.
The more I drive this car, the more I love it.  I am not quite used to the 6-speed but I've had multiple people tell me I'm much smoother in the SVT than in the Camaro.  That is just a put-down in disguise but I'll take it anyway!

Woohoo, the MPx220 is now officially on Motos website!  Here is the  urlLink press release  and here are  urlLink pictures .
Ok, now that I have a semi-respectible car, I'm thinking about taking it autocrossing.  Let me explain in case you have never heard of autocrossing.  Basically, a tight and twisty course is constructed of cones in a large parking lot.  You rarely go over 60 MPH so this is not a high speed sport.  It focuses on cornering and smooth driving.  I'm definitely not good enough with the manual to consider doing it this year but I plan on checking out a few events so that I know what to expect next summer.  Anyway, check out some of these  urlLink course maps  and you'll get a better idea.
Haha, I love this.  Posting to blogger on my laptop that is connected to my Smartphone through Bluetooth while the Smartphone has internet access through GPRS.   Isn't technology wonderful?
So little time or energy to post!  Suppa happy fun bullets are all you get.
Kat and I didn't do much this Fourth of July weekend.  We both had difficult weeks (especially the night where I left work at 12:45 AM and then was up for the next day before 7 AM) so we just took it easy.  Her parents backyard overlooks much of Seattle so we were able to see four different fireworks displays at once (Elliot Bay, Gasworks, Yarrow Bay and Kirkland).
Tonight was the second game of the summer FloorBurn season.  I'm captain already and I've already made a mistake.  I didn't inform everyone we had a game this week (assuming that the manager would take care of that like last season) and only 4 people showed up.  A couple people subbed for us and we ended up winning 3-1!  I almost had a hat trick but the pass I got right in front of the goal was actually about to go into the goal so I just let it go by!
I've spent about eight hours working on my yearly review for Microsoft and I'm only about a third of the way completed.  It is important but not that important.  I just want a fatty raise so I can afford my new car and my $1,570/month rent.
This happened two weekends ago, but Eric of Jenn&Eric fame was in town so Kat, Eric and I grabbed some dinner and dessert.  We had a good time, but it didn't last long enough.  I had an early morning appointment so I had to call the night around 9 PM.
The new car is still super sweet.  To measure how sweet it is, I picked up a  urlLink G-Tech Performance Meter Pro .  I haven't had a chance to try it out yet.  Well, I haven't had a piece of flat, dry, non-cop-infested road to really wring out the car and measure with it yet.  In time.
While the car is still super sweet, the oh-so-smooth shifter is becoming less smooth.  There is some hesitation as the shifter returns to neutral on the way to the next gear.  It almost seems like the linkage is jammed.  Oh well, it should work itself out in time otherwise it is going to the dealer!  I didn't drive this car hard at all yet and I haven't had a gear grind nor have I missed a shift.  If there is a problem, it wasn't my fault.
I've been playing a ton of GT3 lately, now that Russ has moved out.  I can play the really long races or long sets of races and just leave the PS2 running while I go to work.  I can play a bit, do something else then go back to an unmolested PS2.  I've already won an F1 car so now it's basically a game of "How many times can I pass everyone before I win!".  I love that game.
Just in case I decide to care about this crap later, my car is #761 out of 1978 built and was built on 07Jan2004.
I've removed the links to my Gallery as I haven't had time to repopulate it since it was destroyed.  I have added a new album though!
urlLink SVT Focus 07.11.2004
Jeff complained that I used a Microsoft building as my background and not Mt. Rainier.  I knew that this parking garage would be in full sunlight and completely open.  I can take pictures just about wherever I want and he's a negative fuck anyway!
Now that I have the SVT Focus, I've put the Camaro up for sale.  I have so far only posted it in the Microsoft classifieds but anyone in the Puget Sound area can take a look at these.  I put the car up two weeks ago and I got a phone call last Wednesday:
Her: I'm calling about the Camaro.
Me:  Ok, it's still available.
Her: Can I come see it?
Me:  Sure, when works for you.
Her: How about this weekend?
Me:  Ok, when?
Her: Oh, I don't know, lunchtime?
At this point, I got a little bit frustrated.  I dont want to hear "lunchtime", I want a specific time and date.  Anyway, I finally got her to decide on Saturday at noon.  She calls me Friday morning (a call I missed since I was in the parking garage) and says that she can't do it on Saturday and that Sunday at 5 PM would work better.  Ok, that is fine.  I get a voicemail Sunday at roughly 4 PM to say she can't make it at 5 PM and would Monday work.   I call her back, no answer, so I left a voicemail saying that Monday would be fine if she would please tell me a specific time.   She emails me this morning to say that either 6 or 7 PM would work.  I told her to give me a specific time and if she was going to change that time to tell me by 2 PM.  She writes back, saying 7 PM would be fine.   Here we are, 5:30 PM and she calls:
Her: Hi Mike, I just wanted to see if we could meet earlier.
Me:  Well, we decided on 7 PM.
Her: I know, but I was wondering if we could meet at 6 or 6:30 PM.
Me:  I already said that I would need to know by 2 PM if you were going to change the time.
Her: I know, I was just wondering if you could get off work early.
Me:  No, but 7 PM works for me.
Her: Ok.
Me:  (Cutting her off) Bye.  ::CLICK::
Holy cow.  I bet you $100 that she is going to show up 15 minutes late and then not know how to drive a manual transmission.  Just wait.
UPDATE:  She can't drive a manual!   But, this is a car for her (I think) younger brother so I will give her a little slack.
Sigh, I hate moving.  Russ gave me not quite enough notice to find a roommate so I'm moving out.  I even paid the entire rent plus the month-to-month penalty plus the extra parking spot for a month hoping I would find someone.  No such luck.
Katherine has graciously offered living with her for a short while until I find someone else to room with.  I am going to move the majority of my stuff into a storage unit and move the necessities over to her townhome.  Actually, I've already moved most of my hanged clothes and shoes.  Over the weekend, I hope to pack up everything so that I can get a mover next week to bring it all to a storage unit.  No way am I going to try to move my couch, queen bed, bookshelves et cetera by myself.
The real kicker here is that I didn't give my apartment enough notice that I was leaving.  When I went from the year lease to a month-to-month lease, they never said anything about a "twenty day notice".  On a month-to-month, that's a huge amount of notice!  I wanted to move out at the end of July but they are so graciously allowing me to pay $1470 for all of August.  They said that if someone moves into the apartment, they will pro-rate the amount and pay me back.  I somehow doubt that is going to happen!  Sigh.
Ok, really weird dream.  Here are some of the highlights:
Set in a time where USA and the Soviet Union are at a full-on war.
The first part of the dream sees me running across an American battlefield, trying to avoid bullets, mines, bombs, missiles and just about every other type of munition.
I saw a very large passenger jet, presumably American, get hit by a missle and then crash into the sea.  This jet was filled with Olympic athletes.
At this point, the dream becomes more of a movie and I am delegated to observer status.
A rag-tag group of Americans decide that the only way to stop the Soviet Union is to infiltrate their country and kill their leader.  The group of Americans consist of a female Olympic judge, a 12-year-old girl and an older guy that looks like James Earl Jones.
This group has to train to be able to infiltrate the country.  Instead of learning military techniques, they learn how to train water snakes.
I don't remember how, but all of a sudden the entire group is in the heart of the Soviet Union.  The unnamed leader is hiding out in a rural town in a boarding house.
The little girl sneaks upstairs, undetected, to find the leader sleeping amongst 15 other people from the town. The girl places a rag of some sort of chemical over the leaders mouth, knocking him out.  Instead of just killing him, the girl saws off his head with a dull machete and puts it into a burlap bag.  No one has yet noticed anything has happened.  She sneaks downstairs and runs outside.
Just as she joins the rest of her group hiding behind a bush outside, there is a sound much like the sharpening of a machete.  From an open window upstairs, the now-dead body of the leader with a ghostly head starts to appear in the window.  At first, it's safe to assume he is about to brandish a machete when instead he pulls out a .50 cal machine gun (the type that is normally truck mounted).  Before he can fire, the James Earl Jones character grabs a gun from the ground and sprays the leader with bullets.
The end.
Quick post again.
I went to a RallyCross on Sunday ( urlLink pictures ).&nbsp; It was fairly interesting, but I'm not subjecting my only car to that treatment.&nbsp; Today I got my new Microsoft Prime card (discount card for restaurants, hotels, etc).&nbsp; The old design was fairly metrosexual (polka dots and all) but the new one takes the cake!

I agree that Battleblog is ok to do whilst hungover.  Good clear indication of transfer to your personal log John.  When the pain is gone, move on.    I'd like to say have a happy new year to all in blogland.  Have a happy century, happy year of the snake (...or duck),  and happy 3rd millennium.  I personally feel we should remake the calender with July, 1969 as our starting date... no not Woodstock...mankind's first step on another celestial object, the moon!!!
I believe any spoon will do John.  Pour the guiness secondly over a spoon so that the pressure doesn't penetrate the Bass or whatever the lower lighter beer is and I think that's it.  I might be wrong, because I've never actually made a black and tan, but I think that's the idea.  Let me know how it went.
Well, at my parents house the drunkenfish comes up as corners of pictures and totally out of whack.  Now, I understand a little of John's recent complaints.  I haven't been catering to 800x600 cave people or netscape even for that matter.  I took a look at Tanque, just to see if he catered to the display impaired and he does.  Well, I'm not gonna let that punk ass site out do my user friendliness, so my next goal is to make the pages look halfway decent at the incredibly low resolution in which I'm finding so many people view the net.  Another change to the the site is going to include deleting two of the original bloggers, because they are not blogging.  I know... harsh language for drinking buddies, but if you don't use it, you lose it.  They'll both be given an e-mail and if no response is sent then there will only be 3 bloggers on the drunkenfish.  Hopefully, we'll be able to rustle up so more bloggers soon.
In 1555, Nostradamus wrote:   "Come the millennium, month 12,  In the home of greatest power,  The village idiot will come forth  To be acclaimed the leader.
I did the  urlLink machine version  of anagram fun and I didn't come up with much, but I at least feel better about my anagram,  which the machine actually didn't come up with.
"one ninjas member" was all I could come up with for an anagram to Benjamin Emerson.  That kinda sucks...need to think about it some more.
There... that eel is much better.  I got alot done on the page today, but no one will ever notice.  First of all, my story pages all really just hooked up to tanque.org before and now they're legit.  Also I got the pictures and links on proper for those pages... like I said, it's not very obvious, but it took me a while.  You don't have much time before the end of the year Jim.  I sure would like to see something from anyone in tanque.org as well.  I realize by whinning, that I'm not winning over any potential writers, but I don't seem to be winning over any potential writers anyway, so what the hell.   That  urlLink article  that  urlLink Amos  hyperlinked to on his page is scary... I already suspected that the Supreme Court was going to remain republican simply because of the retirement times chosen by the republican majority, but to see the hearsay right on the written page sent a chill up my spine.  We'll see how many of them retire in the next 4 years.
Haven't bought any family Christmas gifts yet, except for my mom's, which I just received an e-mail from Amazon.com saying it wouldn't make it by Christmas.  I'm not off to a roaring start this holiday season.
This is very annoying... I can't keep my eel picture up on the page because everytime I post, the blogger html deletes it.  hmmm... I suppose, I'll have to figure something out here.
Man... I was at my company Christmas luncheon and a lady asked, "Guys, we need these chairs put around the tables."  and I'm thinking "Guys?  Why is that a guy job?"  I got up and helped lift chairs from the stack to put around the tables, but I'm really getting sick of women using chilvary as an excuse to be lazy.  I don't feel better about myself for lifting heavy objects.  Actually, I just feel like a moron for listening to whatever woman is using me.  I've had ladies stop in front of a door and expect me to walk around them to open it for them.   "Bitch!"  I'd just as soon push them on the ground to get to the door.  It's especially bad here in the South.  My boss (who is a woman) will always tell other women, "oh, let the boys do that for you."  Homey don't play that.  Actually, the pathetic part is I do.  But anyday now, I'm going to put my foot down and say, "no you lazy bitch, carry it yourself."  Well, someday maybe.
I know that eel isn't too impressive, but I couldn't find much on eels.... I hope with further searching, I find a more worthy eel.  If someone else knows of a better eel ... let me know.
I posted earlier talking about Alanis Morissette and I thought that I really only liked that one song "Thank U", but I just listened to the whole cd and I feel a little more deeply about the whole project.  Yes, I'm drunk, but I think that even though I don't identify with the things she says all the time, and yes alot of it sounds musically the same, but she is speaking for herself.  Just like Lennon did.   It's nice to hear.  I recommend a second listen, incase anyone has dismissed Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.  It seems to me to be an honest cd and the musical effort is very worthy.  Just thought I'd plug that, because there isn't much today that is in that realm of truthfulness with that kind of skill.  I recommend logging on to Napster and downloading any song off that album at random.
I just thought of something...  believe it or not.   BattleBlog probably is viewed by alot of random people simply because we blog often in a short period of time.  On the main blogger site I always like hitting on the recent post of others and while BattleBlog is in motion, it probably appears several times, appearing very often on the list of choices that have just been posted to.  Also at a drunkenfreindly time, so the name might even inspire a click.   Follow?  That's really kind of a scary thought.  Yeeeha!

Well, now that Gore has been thouroghly fucked in the ass, do you suppose he has been softened to the plight of the average american?  Does Prince Albert understand that wall of cold indifference that stands before us all and leaves us powerless to affect the powers that be?  Perhaps, this will create a greater man of Al Gore.  Perhaps a real defender of the american people will be born from this experience.  Perhaps, he'll just fly into a maddening swirl of jealousy and hunger for power.  Time will tell, I suppose.  What has this election done to me?  Well, the illusion that the Supreme Court is some kind of sanctuary for truth and justice has been obliterated.  No institution is beyond corruption and it is a part of growing up, to understand that.  I also feel that no individual is beyond corruption.  I guess that means that controlling my own morallity and sense of justice is about the only thing I can do.  A friend of mine asked me the other day how I could possibly have morality without believing in God.  "You could do whatever you wanted," was the phrase used.  True.  One can do whatever one wants to do.  I think the world is more beautiful knowing that, fully understanding that, and then marvelling at how well we all actually get along.  It's amazing to me.  Certainly our societies are not morally held together by the instituions of religion.   We can easily take a glance at any moment in recorded history to see that there is corruption in those systems.  The individual is the foundation of morality.  The golden rule.  No governmental body is ever going to be perfect, but the lessons, like this Supreme Court decision, dropping the atomic bomb, the creation of Israel, letting Rush Limbaugh have a radio program, etc..., hopefully teaches us and fills our history, our collective memory, and aids us in making better choices in the future.   The song "Thank-you" by Alanis Morrisette is a good reflection of that thought.
Here is the ultimate way to experience  urlLink Mardi Gras .  Check out the pictures page on that site.  I gots to get me a sneaky leaker!
Go China!   urlLink Manned Spaced Flight within the next 5 years .  Coolness.  Maybe China can get the ball rolling a little faster on space colonization.  I'm taking off work 30 minutes early so I can get home in time for Gore's speech.  I am so ready for a political revolution.  We don't need to change the things that work... just the things that in this day and age are idiotic.  Our system failed this election.  I'm sure Gore will be very statesman-like and concede gracefully, but part of me wants him to address my anger.
How many times can one refresh the screen while on the AP newsline?  I think I set some sort of record today.  Well, the Supreme Court got sleepy I guess so they quit for today.  "Yawn... we're the Supreme Court, no one is going to rush us.  We already knew how we were going to rule on all of this way back on friday anyway.  Silly lawyers.  Silly voters."
Jimmy had a good idea in the drunken battle blog and now it's real.  Certainly you can write drunkenly on your own weblogs, but this might be fun.  Let me know if you people want these posts anonymous or with a name stamp.  For now, you will be identified.  I repeat, you will be identified.  I wanted to go off on the  U.S. Supreme court and the Florida legislature, but I just don't have the energy.  There truly is no thing as justice.
...and uh... let us all bow our heads a moment for the god of rock n' roll, Mr. John Lennon.  I remember in 1980 walking around in a slump for weeks trying to look more depressed than my musical buddy Will Sibley in school, so that he understood that I was a bigger Lennon fan than him.  I still have my beat up old White Album Lennon photo above my bedroom door as I always do in every place I've ever lived.  When all is said and done though... I don't believe in Lennon..... I just believe in me.... Yoko and me... and that's reality.
Wahooooo!!!  They're counting ballots in Florida!  I can't help, but think that the Republicans are just plain evil for pushing their power in the legislature to override the will of the people and decide for themselves who their electoral votes should go to.  Just plain evil.  It's a sure sign that we need to take those ancient powers away.  I think nobody has bothered to take them away, because they never imagined in this day and age that anyone would stoop so low as to use them.   We are an edumacated society now.  I would certainly not want my vote overriden by someone who thinks they know better than me.  urlLink The space microbe!!!  That is cool.  It seems though, that it would be very likely that a) the weather balloon was contaminated or b) it swirled up to the stratosphere by natural processes or c) we find that the biosphere is larger than we previously thought.  I don't find it too suprising either that it was a totally new species of bacterium.  I would suppose their are thousands or millions of unknown bacterium.  Still, I do favor the theory that life was brought to earth by comets and asteroids.  I guess that makes this part of my blog and the entire news report kind of meaningless all around.  I sure wish we could have somekind of wonderful scientific discovery that knocked us all on our collective ass.  I sure could use that kind of boost of excitement right about now.
John not only removed the chocolate from his chin, he removed his first post!  That's not the true spirit of drunkenfish.  You live with what you say here mister.  They'll be no nancyboy retraction because you kinda sorta feel some sweet thing might be offended.  What's the fun of drunkenly making an ass of yourself, if you erase it before anyone gets the chance to read it?  On another note, the DSL dude never showed up.  It's been over a month since I placed my order.  Screw 'em.  I'll wait until later to get it.
Well, the DSL installer dude is coming in the morning.  Should I clean up my pad for the DSL dude?  I don't think so.  I mean the most he could say would be, like "Fuck, you're a slob!" and that would be the end of it.  Well, I've finished off the Stoli an O.J., so I guess it's bedtime.  I'm counting on him showing up at 1pm since he said he would be here between 8am and 12pm.

Ok.... I know... this all looks like shit, but I'm just playing around.... bare with me a while.   By the way, this is or was a cool picture of IO, but it just really doesn't have a place on this page I'm afraid... it's a real photo... not a painting.  I'm going to leave this up for a very short while so all can see the beauty of this volcanic moon.  Io is a moon around Jupiter slightly smaller than our own moon.   Some cool trivia:  It is said by scientists that sometimes lightning travels from Jupiter to the surface of Io and that it also has a weather system in this thin atmosphere that includes yellow sulfur snow.
Wow!  Blogger is flying now.   ....well, it's flying, but it still didn't let me publish on my first try.
I might not be addressing what is being asked, but Emily Dickinson will do anything to acquire the sympathy of the audience in her head and the toad is the lowest thing she could think of to compare herself to.  At the same time, she defends her miserable state by declaring that she is just like anything else in this world.  She also turns on those who she feels are without pain and who don't understand her self-centered misery by calling them braggarts.  I can't stand reading Dickinson because it is too close a reflection of that pathetic part of me that is always present.
Blahhhhh....  I was sick all week-end.  Work was about 300 percent more stressful than it usually is.  I'm learning the same software that Sonya is.  Dreamweaver, Flash, and Photoshop.  My pirated versions are older than the current versions, but hopefully it's enough to get started on them to somewhat know what I'm doing when I get to England.  I'm also looking into Mercantec SoftCart because small businesses are what I believe Chris' company is going to cater to.  I haven't played with that one at all yet, but at least I can kind of visualize how I need to use it when planning my templates.  No, I don't have any templates made yet, but I think I'll make up some practice ones to get familiar with the whole process before I get there.  The real ones will come after I see exactly what we're looking for.  Doesn't seem right that a Yank like me should be designing the look of an English website when I know absolutely nothing about England.  Anyway, who am I to argue.... I'm going to ENGLAND!!!!   YAAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOOEEY!!!!   Of course, this move and career change isn't doing much for my stress level... I'm a mess.   I mean it's nice to trade in all of your current worries for a new set of 'em, but that whole grey sea I see before me isn't the North Atlantic, I'll tell you that.  On the preparation side of it all... I haven't started the passport process yet, I haven't sold my car, (although I just put almost $1000 into fixing it last week), I haven't shipped my computer yet (which I'm told takes at least a couple of months to get there by boat.),  no salary has been agreed upon yet,  I have a basic understanding of some of the software I'm suppose to know, but I have no real practical experience with any of it, oh yeah, and my credit cards are at max and I'm broke.  Killer, huh.   Did I mention?... I'm going to ENGLAND!!!!   YAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOEEEY!!!!!  Luckily, tax returns will hopefully be accomplished this week and that should remove quite a large chunk of the credit card debt. (especially with all that student loan intrest I paid this year.)  The car selling is my greatest money obstacle and that will clear the rest of my debts and leave me with about $2000 for setting up in the new place.  There is still some hope left that this will all work out just fine.   Feels kinda good to vent all this.
All my dreams in the last year have been real life situations for some reason.  In the past, they have always been really tripped out.  There's got to be some underlying significance to that fact, but I can't come up with any reasonable explanation.  For example, my dream this morning started with me in a typical working environment for some company selling products.  I was sitting at a long table in a room with several other long tables and about 40 people (workers and customers).  An African-American woman holding the hand of an eight year old girl was talking to me about a product she might be interested in.  At some point in the conversation she had decided that she wasn't interested.  Her eight year old daughter looked at me with a very sad face because she wanted it.  (I have no idea what the product was)  Anyway, for some reason the sad child's face made me chuckle and say to her "You know, if you whine and cry enough she may just buy it."  At that, the child smiled at me.  The woman was right there still holding the childs hand, but was involved with other thought processes.  The comment by me was meant to be heard by both of them, but apparently she missed it and not being concerned because it really wasn't that funny anyway I went back to working on whatever I was working on before the woman approached me.  Shortly after that, I heard the woman scream at her kid to shut up or she'd spank her right here in front of everybody.  The little girl started bawling and pointed at me saying, "that man told me to!"  The mother glanced in my direction and so I thought maybe I'd save the kid a spanking by saying, "yes ma'am, I did say that but..."  I was going to say that I meant the comment to be heard by her as well, but she cut me off saying, "You don't use my kid to sell me a product!"  The entire room of people were staring at me.  An elderly woman who was some really high up person in the company decided to approach me speaking very loudly.  "Listen, you don't ever..."  I cut her off.  "Look, when I said that, I was just thinking that..."  The old woman cut me off.  "No!  You don't treat a customer..."  She was speaking even louder and everyone was watching.  At this point I kind of lost it and cut her off with an extremely loud, "HEY! Get out of my face, lady!"  At this there was a deep shocked breath from everyone in the room.  Not only had I tried to use a child to sell a product, now I'd screamed and upset an old lady.  I looked at my boss waiting for the enevitable "You're fired!" but instead she said, "why don't you go grab a cup of coffee, Ben", which was probably just a nice way of saying, "You're fired!"  I said, "Thank you.  I'd like that about now."  Then I woke up.   Has my mind lost all creativity?... I don't know.  I really preferred the tripped out dreams more.  When are they coming back?
Well, a woman was suppose to come see my car today (to buy), but she never showed up.  I'm sure glad I didn't waste the time of cleaning it.
is drunkenfish back up?
I agree with John that without religion, the basic principles of good and evil are meaningless.  (therefore, under my beliefs, the basic principles of good and evil are meaningless unless I'm talking to or about a religious person.)  I have my own definitions of what I believe is good or bad in how to live life , but I don't feel that an individual is good or evil.  It's all relative for each individual.
I remember in the not so distant past, physicists saying they could slow down light in a tube to some ungodly slow speed and now I read  urlLink this.   I'm not sure of the use, but damn, that seems an awfully powerful accomplishment.   Actually, it's unfathomable for me to understand.
No, I'm not finished bitching about religion yet.  While we're at it, we need to tax the church!  I read where churches are giving campaign money to elections.  What the hell?  I'm not going to just sit here allowing my country to turn into the religious right.  Am I going overboard here?  The republicans say that we should play nice, since Dubya is in office now... "we need to heal".... fuck you, we're gonna stick you in the ass just like you did to us over the last 8 years.  We're not going to let you make one feeble step in the wrong direction.  (like I have a say in any of this)  Already, Dubya is planning to overturn environmental and social programs. I hope the liberal left is an awesome foe for the right.  Never will it be time to give in to the dark side.  I got a little sidetracked on my religious topic.  Perhaps, I'm really not upset with religion at all... just the right wing's connection to it.  Nah, religion sucks too.
I just read  urlLink an article  about the Bush presidency and it seems as though they will do everything in their power to blend church and state.  Ugh....  back to the middle ages!   John's talking about God is a personal thing and I think that's cool (kind of like me talking about one of my 50+ personalities), but when the government starts making policy around these beliefs, it bothers me.  I tell myself to just get off the religious condemnation, but it keeps slapping me in the face.  How can I just sit quietly when most in the world base their decisions on mythology?  I'm sorry, it's rude to put down others beliefs, but I just don't get it.  Did I miss that drug?  I thought I had 'em all.  Anyway, I'm the last to say what is real and what is not, but (for the millionth time I've probably said it)  the government has no business in religion.   We are a secular state . ..I just sound like a jerk everytime I mention this subject...  Oh, screw you people of Earth!   The monks and demons that fly around your heads are real because you created them...... you are the only God of yourself.  Blah, blah, blah.......  Like I'm actually going to convince anyone by being an ass.
I have decided that (as Ned hinted at earlier) I was kind of an ass when I deleted users for not posting.  I've changed the fascist policy and now believe that it's a free blog page.... blog as you like, I won't delete anyone.  Also now, our lovely friend Yogurt is back in action in the second chapter of John's sci-fi, The Tea House.  Check it out!
Well, I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy inside for donating just now to blogger.  Wait the feeling is fading, I must make others my scapegoat to bring the feeling back.  I will use the tool of guilt!  Have you donated to blogger yet?  Well, have you? You can bring the feeling back  urlLink here .
Man, it's impossible for anyone who actually needs money to get a loan.  Yes, I know, a lesson I should know well by now.  My credit is good, but I don't have colateral.  Student loans are a bitch!  Anyway, I was checking out a newspaper article on the Manchester scene and they said that just about every person under the age of 30 is in a band, just left a band, or is managing someone else's band.  Also, the article said it was one of the largest concentration of college students in Europe.  Another bonus to my lifestyling.  I'm hoping to get my own flat very quickly, but I'm a little clueless on how that all works with a temporary working visa.  I need to just settle my brain... whew... breath....  ok... I've got 2 months of N'awlins left before I'm off.  I need to start learning web design or this whole thing is going to be a bit embarrassing.
I really should have battleblogged last night.  I hate to waste a good drunk like that.  Well, actually it wasn't a total waste, I did finish another Crunch chapter.  I'm playing two new computer games an awful lot lately.  One is Diablo2 which I play with Jimbo and the other is Vampires, The Masquerade.  Both eat up way too much of my time, but I'm sure I'll be sick of them soon enough.
Welcome Andy Kennedy from the sunny state of Florida!  As a new blogger to drunkenfish, I'd like to encourage you to post often and write stories and encourage Jim and John to get off their collective ass and write stories also.  Really you can do whatever the hell you like here, but I thought I'd at least get my wishes out front in the open.  Try sampling the DrunkenBattleBlog... it's yummy.  It's becoming the covenant of the Drunkenfish neighborhood to pick a sea creature picture for your blog page as well.  Wow...so many demands for a page of drunks.  Anyway, like I was saying... WELCOME ANDY!!!
I finally made up my mind where I'm moving... I thought I had made up my mind many times before this, but I think I'm solid with this one.  ENGLAND!!!!!!   Manchester, England.  Cousin Chris is setting me up for the trip, getting me settled, and giving me a job in his new company.  I'm hoping to get heavy into web page design as my career, but I'm very willing to work as a tech until my designing skills improve.  I looked at Flash for the first time today.  Cool program... I just have to take it home and play with it.   Anyway, I'll be moving at the end of February.  Hope I can sell my car and computer by then. Fuck yesssss!  I'm very excited.
Well, I'm going to be without a computer for awhile 'cause I'm boxing this one up to send overseas.  Looks like you have the drunkenfish to yourself John.  I'm sure I'll find some computer somewhere to report in from time to time until I'm set up again.  Wish I had something really cool to say at this point, but alas the brain cells aren't sparking...  as they say in English, "I'll talk to you later!"
sorry to post your story without asking John, but that was the first complete chapter I've got from you and I can't resist.... A new story is born on the drunkenfish.... Chapter 1, Bonobo Man!
My favorite Prez was FDR.  I probably don't have alot of intellegent or knowledgable things to say about the man, except damn could he make policy.  The country was in hardship and he put people to work no matter what it took.  He really didn't seem to be confined by the conventional methods of the current political system... it seemed to me that the man had a mission to save our country in any way possible and he did, by using intellegence and compassion and common sense.  Three cheers for the great mind of FDR!
My last day of work and I'm awake 5 hours before I have to be awake.  I'm just going to go in early and get it over with.  Wow, I have 2 weeks of free time... hurm, what will I do?   I'll do what any respectable Drunkenfish would do with 2 weeks of free time in New Orleans during Mardi Gras... I'll watch T.V!!!
I think finally I have to just let go of R.E.M. Up really hurt me and I don't think this new album is going to help me recover.  Oh to have the days back of Seven Chinese Brothers, or South Central Rain or Moral Kiosk or even Gardening at Night....  The snail's pace of evolution for the band that involves repeating songs from previous albums and altering them ever so slightly annoys the hell out of me.  Anyway, with that wonderful introduction here are two new songs off the new album "Reveal".  urlLink  The Lifting   and   urlLink She Just Wants to Be.
Well, it's the day after Valentine's Day and I think I'm going to puke.  Not that I have anything against Valentine's Day, but just because I'm one of those pathetic bachelors that went out drinking at the meat markets looking for those single women who were trying to be a part of the Valentine's feeling they had welling up in themselves.  I came very close to asking the beautiful young barmaid if she would mind if I just stuck my pinky in her exposed white supple cleavage for a few seconds, but that's about as close to love as I came to last night... I am deeply suffering from the hangover from hell.... Help!  I need morphine.....
Did someone say religion?  (caution: I will deny that I've said anything of which I'm about to say because this is an experiment to allow myself to express a side of me that has to this moment been neatly tucked away as irrational and therefore not explored.)  I've got secret beliefs that come much closer to Wicca than any other organized religion.   Kind of scary to admit and impossible to defend, so it's not something I'll be discussing in too much detail.  This loosley strung together belief system provides me with an explanation for the events I have witnessed in my life in which an overwhelming feeling pulled me from my trained rational perspective.  For instance, I believe that those who die violent deaths have a tendency to hang around after they're dead.  Yes, I know that one is straight out of the horror movies, but I've got my reasons.  I believe that when you die that you are not suddenly enlightened to the ways of the universe.  If you believed in God when you were alive, you probably will when you're dead.  I really don't associate religion with moral structure... I suppose most would think then that I've missed the point, but for me as an Atheist all my life, I have tried to live a loving, harmonious co-existence with my fellow human beings and it was not my fear or admiration for a deity that has held me to my behavior.  To me, religion or mythology or mysticism are all just an effort to explain beliefs that were not explainable through rational means.  (like the feeling of having an immortal soul when no evidence supports it.)  In any case, I agree with all the moral conclusions said in recent posts and i think it really doesn't matter how you rationalize your reality as long as you can create an enjoyble world for those around you and as long as you show enough respect for others to let them feel comfortable in whatever workable reality they have chosen.
Anyone coming to New Orleans for Mardi Gras?... if so look me up in the book when you get here.  I'm not leaving New Orleans until after gras, of course.
Ned - Alright, I retract the silly quick base pi response... I suppose you have to have a whole of something to base a number system on.  I guess my final guess on the subject would be that changing the numerical base would have absolutely no effect on turning pi into an exact number.
By the way, does anyone know how to stretch a background image in html so that it would adjust to any sized screen area with a smaller file?
Either I am on drugs now that I don't see the logic or I was on drugs when I made the assumption that base pi would produce an exact number for pi, either way I challenge you to prove the theory wrong.  yuck, yuck  :)
Ned, the answer to your question about a numerical system that makes pi an exact (you said even, but I assumed you meant exact) number is yes, base pi.
I know this is a huge ass background file.  I'll see what I can do to lessen the load of it, but I like it.
oops... misunderstood the miso soup thing... I was thinking of a competing writers' forum, but alas Sonya was talking about a published book of short stories...  sorry.... I take back the booooo thing and all that stuff about the foul angel from heaven and being forsaken, etc... sorry, nothing to see here.... *whistling a casual tune whilst pretending to read an upside-down magazine*
Miso Soup?  *whimper, sniffle...*  Fine... Mark this Day!  The Drunkenfish writing forum will be BIG, you'll see.... Lo and behold the clouds parted and a holy light shined down upon the small drunken site exposing the young men of Benjamin and John who looked up at the Miso Soup God screaming.... "Boooo!!!  You foul angel from Heaven... we will not be forsaken...boooooo!"
What the hell is going on over there in the tanque?  Those people are brutal with each other.  (Cat imprisonment, A mob of seething women, chickenhead licking, ...)  I'm sure glad we're so much more civilized over here at the drunkenfish.
couldn't make it happen as a backdrop... anyway,  urlLink here  is the picture I was talking about.
Congrats on the NPR reference library gig, Amos!  Sounds like an organization that fits exactly with what I know of you.
More English trivial differences...  People are always asking me if I'm alright?  "You alright Ben?"  It took me awhile to understand that they are just saying:  How are you? or What's up?  I'd get really strange looks when I would say "I'm fine... why?"  I was figuring they had noticed something wrong with me.  Also I'm told by loved ones around me that I have two looks in my way of dressing.  One is a country bumpkin (that's my flannel and jeans look), the other is the old man look (that's my sweater, button down shirt, and dress pants).  I was asked yesterday if I ever get stared at... I replied, "well... yes, but I thought..." (as I looked up to a room full of friends shaking their heads).  I'm told that if I'm going to pick up an English bird then I've got to change my American look.  Do I let others dress me and admit I look like a nerd?  Do I stand my ground like a man and say, "Rubbish, I look fine."?  or maybe I should just say, "I don't care what I look like, and then slowly transform on my own."   Some suggestions to me were 1.) Cargo Pants... sorry, never going to happen; 2.) Leather... maybe a jacket, but that takes money that I don't have at the moment; 3.) Lighter weight, darker coloured (yikes my spelling is changing) sweaters without the collared shirt underneath....hmmmmmm, no.  Damn it! I'm not a doll !!!  I think, I'm just going to go with the flowered Moomoos, sandels, and perhaps a comfortable bonnet.
Hmmmm.... Superpower?  I already have the superpower of being able to have an entire conversation with another person by only listening to the key words.  Is that a superpower or just being shallow?   The power to keep a job would be nice.  A little will power would be nice.  God-like power is out of the question because that would complete the process of removing me from humanity and I'm really doing my best to hold on to that.  I suppose I would like my eyes to glow red when I was mad at someone, like in "B" movies.  That would keep most people off my back.
I miss hearing from you John.  Are you giving your wife some quality time away from the posting?  Not that posting isn't real life or anything.....
I didn't think I'd just be writing about all the minor, quirky little things that make England different, but I guess that's what's on my mind, so what the hell.  The toilets here have longer handles for the most part and are located on the opposite side of the toilet from the ones in the U.S.  It takes about 3 flushes for the water to actually start flowing, (this is not just the toilet in my current residence, it's all over) but once it starts flowing everything is off to the races down a very large toilet exit and a very large sewage pipe.  Toilets don't get stopped up here very easily because of the larger pathways to sewage freedom.  That's all and good I suppose, but it makes it very difficult for me to win my favorite game, "Beat the Toilet."
Jim A. - I have noticed a change in Ned's posts as well.  Has Ned reached a new plateau of content with life?  Is he just at ease with himself because of the splendid heavy activity of tanqueville?  or as you said before, maybe he's just smoking alot of pot.  Anyway, Ned's new glasnost policy warms the heart.
Where's Decaffe Jake staying Jim?  I know you wish you could bring him along somehow?  ...and yes, marijuana should be legal and heavily taxed... but even though I am a drunk, I still think booze and cigs need to be taxed heavily too...and as I've mentioned before... CHURCHES NEED TO START PAYING TAXES!!!.... and while I'm at it... we should have a wealth tax and not an income tax.... Oh, I need to start getting ready to leave on today's field trip.  I'm going off to visit three of the coolest (according to Chris) castles of Wales.  I've been nagging him since I arrived.  Apparently the English don't get along too well with the Welsh, because everytime I mention Wales the people around me roll their eyes.  I like listening to the Welsh radio station here just to hear them talk in Gaelic.  Beautiful...  I can listen to it all day, but the English can only take a few seconds before their brains melt.  The castles I'm going to today, as expected, were built by the English while conquering Wales.  One last note before I scarf down my sausages and pork n' beans and head out for the day... the traffic lights here are a bit strange... you get a yellow light before the green light.   I suppose it gives you the chance to push the gas pedal to the metal so that you are ready to pop the clutch on the green.
Welcome Back Amos!
Damn, I was a depressing monkey last night.  Amazing what a couple bottles of wine will do to a person's emotional state.  Amazing what a good night's sleep will do to improve a mood as well.  Yuck, I think I'm gonna puke... not from a hang over, but disgust from the memory of being so sappily melodramatic.  Anyway, IT'S ST. PATRICK'S DAY!!!!!!!!!   Time to start drinkin'....
Well, I walked through Liverpool, but not much happened.  I saw the Cavern.  I saw the statue of John Lennon leaning against a wall.  Nothing hit me very strongly.  I did get into a discussion with Chris late into the drunken night about an old friend that committed suicide and tears came from my eyes, but I felt only too foolish for being so drunk.  Chris was very kind and I hate to use up my empathy points from other people just because I'm drunk and pulling forth emotional scenes that I should be well over.  It's very late here and (did I mention?) I'm drunk and I'm going to bed.  St. Patty is today and I've got to get what sleep I can to be as complaisant as my currently unsettled soul can be in the daylight hours of another drinking fest... night all.
Wahooo!  I'm sitting in an office building, looking over the fine city of Liverpool.  In a few minutes, Chris and I are going to look around the city and I (unlike Chris) will be looking for Beatle nostalgia.
Well, I'm not a religious man, but this god-seeking man who I can tell by his bottle labels is obviously some sort of kindred spirit to John, makes an awesome liquid  urlLink peppermint soap  that doubles as a shampoo.  No, I wasn't paid off by a buddy to push this stuff... I just love it.
Oooooooo Dreamweaver, I believe you can get me through the ni-hight!   Ok... I'm sick of reading my Dreamweaver book and I just started.  I can't wait to learn info like in the Matrix...  "Can you fly that thing?"  "Not yet...  Operator, I need a Dreamweaver 3, Flash 5, Photoshop 6, Fireworks 3, Dynamic HTML program and I need it now!"
I hesitated to buy Jack and Cokes here, thinking maybe that was just an american thing, but everyone reassured me that every place has those.  Problem is they come in a glass slightly larger than a shot glass and only about half full.  Last night I was out in an Indian Cuisine Restaurant and ordered a Jack and Coke and the man said, "would you like that in a tall glass?"  I enthusiastically said, "YES!"  When I got the drink, it was in a very tall toothpick sized glass about 1/16th of the way full.  I have switched my drink now to cider.  There is lots of it and it's cheap.  I got the chance to jam on the guitar last night for the first time in a while.  I just played the standard blues riffs and chords, but it was loads of fun for me.  They have my brand of cigs here, Camel Lights, although they don't really taste quite the same and instead of it saying Turkish blend, it says American blend.  hmmm....
I hit backspace and my last whole blog transferred to the great beyond... who knows where that is... anyway, here are some of the things I mentioned...  1.  There are huge thugs wandering the streets of Manchester with smashed in noses, no necks, and tiny blue eyes... straight out of a bugs bunny cartoon.  They're everywhere!  I think they are descendants from the rugged factory workers in which this city was founded.  2.  Coffee is huge here...much more than tea.  Everywhere I go, there is a Starbucks filled with people.  Everyone I met here has about 6 cups of coffee a day.  Must be a recent northern England phenomenum.  3.  I haven't found any good T.V. yet with a few exceptions.  There is a show called The Royales where a welfare-like Manchester family is just sitting on the couch every episode watching T.V. and the acting (as a rare exception from any other show I've seen) is very good.  The quiz shows here are all about british culture... I can't answer one damn question.  I'd rather be out and about instead of watching T.V., but I don't have transportation, so I'll entertain myself however I can for now.  I'm going to go out to a friend of Chris's tonight to jam and drink, so maybe I'll get some more real life stories to tell tomorrow.
I do have to mention Chris' darling little 3 year old girl Sophie, who I am completely impressed by.  We went into a restaurant today and she sat down in her chair and said in the cutest english accent "This is a fine place, isn't it?"   She then put her napkin in her lap and said to me, "you need to put your napkin in your lap, Ben."  I said, "You're right, thank you." and did so.  When my food came she asked me, "would you like me to cut that for you, Ben."  I said, "no, I think I can do that, but thank you very much for the offer."  She smiled and started trying to cut her own food.  (mommy had to help a little, but for christ's sakes... she's 3 years old!)
The keyboard command to post (if you ever have a defunct mouse) is "ctrl - enter".
I'm here....  My first impression of Manchester is "Communist Indiana".   The countryside looks exactly like Indiana to me, but the buildings and houses are all red brick and exactly the same as if it were all government housing.  The roads are all about the size of bicycle paths and there are no overhanging wires.... other than all that, there doesn't seem to be much difference.  No one on the street says hello and when I say "hi" they just look at the ground and quicken their pace.  It all changes though when you are sitting down indoors somewhere public and they suddenly morph into the friendliest people you've ever met.  British T.V. is hilarious... the daily soaps remind me of poorly directed jr. high school plays, but the news stations are refreshingly international and seemingly unbiased.  It's funny to me to sit in a pub and look at two ladies in their sixties gabbing away over a glass of scotch as if they do that everyday (and they probably do).  So far, so good... I will have more to say hopefully once I've seen a bit more.  Now if I can just figure out the keyboard commands to post, then I'd be in business.... the box with my mouse hasn't arrived yet.
urlLink SETI@home  has been out for some time, but for some reason I never signed up.  Feeling the guilt, after watching a SETI discussion group on T.V., I installed the screen saver and let it run all last night.  The data I was processing was recorded in December of 2000.
I'm going to add Chris Lea, my cousin, my boss, my landlord, my punching bag, to the drunkenfish.  I don't think he will be posting at all, but he wanted to check out blogger, so I added him just in case he gets the inspiration.  No more introductions for people on the drunkenfish and no one will be offended or anything if they are not added to blog links on any page.  I think that the drunkenfish is a different beast than tanque.  John has become the drunkenfish for me with his excellent posting, but I value all my friends on the drunkenfish regardless if they post or not, so with that...  cheers.  Jim S., let me know if those girls you talked about are interested in posting.  They are very welcome here.  Run to the fish.  Run to the fish.  All are welcome in the fish.
Well, I couldn't go to bed without mentioning my God act thingy even though I'm sure if anyone read it, they just gave a distasteful look at the screen and moved on.  I guess I just know the people (Ned and John) talkin' about him or her or it (God), well enough to know that they know how much of a teenage brat I am about that subject.  I was thinking maybe they would find humor in my assness.  I hope that's the case.  Anyway, good night all.
Hey!  Congrats, Ned.  You made the " urlLink blogs of note ."
Amos - I can't help thinking how easy it will be for the government to manipulate the media and vice versa when all they have to do is make deals with a few individuals.  That's one big part of what scares me so much about all this loosening of limitations for media expansion.  The media argues that with the internet in place that no one is cut off from information, which is a good point, but I still think that too much power lies in print, radio, and television to let the expansion limitations disappear.  Thanks for the newsclip.
Conversation with God - A Play in One Act - by Ben    Ben: God, I think you're a crock of shit.  God: *no response*  The End
I finally finished "Vampire The Masquerade -Redemption".  Wish I could say that was a cool novel or something, but no... video games are about all I spend my free time on these days.  So far, I don't have any paying customers, but there are several on the horizon and I'm doing sample sites to hook them into a deal.  I'm charging about $1000 per standard site with hosting included for a year.  We're all still working out the kinks in our process at the moment, but I'm hoping the company will be in full swing in about a month.  The company is made up of my Cousin Chris - Technical Director; His wife Bridget - Operations Director; Her brother John - Sales Director;  and moi - Web Designer. (I'm not actually legal to work yet, but that should be coming along soon as well)  I'm pretty excited about the whole thing and my end of the business is ready to go, so maybe now is the time that I should be sitting back and enjoying a good book.  Our company site, isn't exactly finished yet and to tell the truth, I'm not real happy with it, but I'm experimenting alot more on the other sites that I'm making and hope to improve the company's site by the time we're up and running. I've posted a few pictures.  I can't wait to take the camera out on the town one night.  Anyway, I've been moved by reading everyone's posts lately and wish I had something to add, but not much is going on with me and adult matters are not my specialty.
Sean - I noticed that Drunkenbattleblog was blank on netscape soon after it was created and didn't know why.  However, my parents use netscape exclusively and I haven't felt the inspiration to fix the problem.  I suppose if anyone has a moment to waste on reviewing the code, I will listen and correct it, but  I just can't find the energy to address it myself for the reason of it being blank for my parents.  (if my parents are reading this... trust me... there's nothing to see there anyway.  Nobody has been drunk on the battleblog for sometime.  I know they won't believe me, but I thought I 'd say it anyway)
My love to you and your mother, John.  Send news at your convenience.
urlLink Dune the miniseries?   Didn't know that was out.  Didn't realize they were redoing  urlLink Planet of the Apes  either.  Man, first I get all riled up about the same old political issues that everybody has been talking about for the last three years or so and then I'm all excited about these two sci-fis that apparently everyone has known about forever already.  I need to start talking to other humanbeings, besides myself, for a change.
urlLink The F.C.C. is loosening it's rules on media expansion limitations  and America's reality is about to be narrowed.  I can't help thinking that the Republican atmosphere in the States is just handing over what remaining control they possess to the corporations.  Actually, perhaps the Republicans are the corporations and are just loosening restrictions on themselves.  Something funny is going on over there and I don't know whether my response should be shame or rage.  What if in the future, this period in history is known as the Corporate Coup?  The people have lost their voices and the corporations and the Repuppetcans are running amok.
Napster is funny as hell to me.  Just mispell your artist or title slightly and lo and behold, there it is.  do you want to find some U2?  well, try "youtoo".  Teenage dirtbag? how about teenage dirtbage.  If you want any Lennon, just drop an "n" (Lenon)   Easter is only slightly different here.  I wanted to dye eggs and hide them, but Bridget looked at me funny and said "Real eggs?"  I said, "Yeah, what do you hide?"  She said, "the kids here would start bawling and get mighty grumpy if they found real eggs instead of chocolate."  By the way, I got a big chocolate egg with my name written with icing on it.  Yum.  I asked if they could just hide little bottles of jack around the yard for me, but I suppose that would be too expensive.  Especially here.
I'm having fun tonight with my Google search on the main drunkenfish page.  I like seeing for instance who used the word "fuck" more often.  I'm sure I'll get bored with this soon and then it will be off to Ned's Google Search for more of the same.  I wonder how many times Ned has said "Hurm".
I am feeling that the DrunkenBattleBlog is going to waste because Jim is busy moving, John is pretty much in the spirit of drunkeness 24/7 so he just posts on his site, and I live with a married couple and a little kid at the moment, so my drinking is way down.  If anyone would like to be a part of DrunkenBattleBlog, for those times when you just need to get it out in an altered state, please e-mail me with the title "Bring it on".  You don't have to post, but it will be there if you need it.  From this point out DrunkenBattleBlog will be completely anonymous (no name tags).  Unless you drunkenly reveal your identity on accident or on purpose.  My e-mail is   urlLink mindevol@hotmail.com            Remember, you don't have to post, but it will be there if you need it. This offer is not just for Tanquers or Drunkenfishies.... Anyone is allowed to DrunkenBattleBlog!
Sonya - Congrats on the orange belt!!!  I think an axe kick is a glam metal term referring to the process of balancing your axe on your foot while swigging a bottle of jack and then catapulting it into the air to catch just in time for the solo. *snort*, *laughter*, *groan*  (Hey John, do you wanna take back that comment about me being funny now.)  Adam - I used to write music, but have temporarily put it aside until I figure out a decent way to make some money. You might think, "nonsense, you can play and do that at the same time," but actually I'm just talking about any money at the moment.  No money, No instruments, No inspiration.  I do Guitar/Bass/Harp/Sing/Songwriting.
Welcome Rob Corwin!  Ned actually lets his new people prepare and launch with style, but not here in the Drunkenfish.  You're just thrown into the tanque with the rest of the drunkenfish and told to swim.  Rob is an old friend of Ned and mine from jr. high, high school and my first college.  He is a very talented graphic artist with a masters in painting, so I'm hoping the blue and white bland screen that I stole from the blogger template will change as he learns html. I'd wait until he actually posts something before actually welcoming him in... (the drunkenfish doesn't have a very good reputation for introducing bloggers who actually blog.)  Thank you John and Jim for sticking around with me... I have high hopes Rob will be around for awhile as well.
Welcome Adam!  I hope you and the other tanquers don't mind links to your pages.  I read (almost everyday) the entire tanque pretty religiously.  Besides, I get a little jealous using Ned's page for links so much.  It's not Tanque.org/df anymore, but I just can't ween myself away from Ned's teat.
well, at least it loads faster...
A few of my thoughts on Pop music-  1.  Pop music is time specific to the date in which a piece is written.  It is geared to please the masses using compositional methods commonly used in the now to please the largest possible audience of the now.    2.  A non-pop song can turn into a genre if others follow the styling, thus leading to sound-alike songs that can become pop as the genre progresses (or in most cases digresses).  I think it would be a mistake to call the creators of a genre, pop.  (Thus early punk will never be pop, but modern punk could creep its way to pop status if it isn't there already)  3.  The Beatles were very pop in their early days because they borrowed compositional methods from popular culture, but I would have to say that alot of songs on Revolver through the White Album were not pop because of the experimentation involved.  4.  Most of Pink Floyd was not pop because of the experimentation involved even though experimentation was popular, as was Pink Floyd.  5.  Pop should not be mistaken for commercial.  (Commercial being music created by a producer)  Shit... need to get back to work...
Ugh... I am so frustrated with all the red tape and bureaucracy that I have to go through to get anything done here.  Today I went to accept a deal for an apartment and then they told me that I owed them 118 quid for them to process my U.K. credit check.    I said, "well, I don't have any U.K. credit.  I just arrived."  They (meaning the property management agency I'm dealing with) said, "Oh, well in that case you have to pay your entire rent up front or get a Guarantor (co-signer)"  I said, "Why can't you just check my U.S. credit?"  They said, "We don't do that."  I said, "Well why don't I go ahead and pay your processing fee and I'll tell you how you can check my credit in the States for about 30 quid."  They said, "Sir, we don't check U.S. credit."  I gave in and said, "Ok my boss will be my guarantor.  Just give me the Guarantor forms and I'll bring them back tomorrow."  They said, "We can't give you those forms until you fill out the credit check forms."  I said, "But I don't have any U.K. credit.  I just arrived."  They said, "I'm sorry, but you have to pay us the 118 quid and we have to process the form anyway."  I said, "But in a worst case scenario where I had the worst credit of anyone in all of the history of the U.K. it wouldn't matter because you are requiring me to have a Guarantor anyway."  They said, "I'm sorry, we have to process your credit report before we can continue with the process."  I said, "May I contact the landlord directly to work this out with him/her?"  They said, "I'm sorry that's privileged information."  I said, "ok, I'll tell you what.  I'm going to go home and fill all this out and I'll talk to you tomorrow."   (I'm not going to fight this because I just want the stupid apartment and start my life already, but sheeez!!!)
Happy Birthday Chris!  May 30th  Happy Birthday Ned!  May 31st
I'd post Ned's D&D stats, but it would be from my memory and what I know of him from the Tanque.  Besides, it's his birthday tomorrow and I wouldn't want to embarrass him with unusually low stats.... oh what the hell,  I'm game...  Ned's Stats -  Str - 13 Int - 16 Dex - 12 Wis - 15 Con - 14  oh yeah, and that high Constitution is because he is a big guy who can take alot of damage.
Ben's D&D stats:  Str - 12 Int - 14 Dex - 13 Wis - 14 Con - 8  My ego might have boosted the Wisdom a little high.  Hmmm... what class would be best for those stats?  Perhaps a Bard...  What about a permanently drunk ninja in very poor health?  After all Benjamin Emerson is an anagram of "mm One Beer Ninja!"  or "Beer Ninja Omen m"  Didn't work out entirely with that anagram, but it's damn close.  I think I'll just have the m's officially removed from my name so that it works.  Benjain Eerson  It's just a little weird (like  urlLink Phil  said) to post one's own D&D stats, but how about this for crossing social faux pas lines:  Here's what I think John's and Jim's stats are:  John:   Str - 15  Int - 14  *Dex - 13  Wis - 16  Con - 14             Jim S.:    Str - 11  Int - 16  Dex - 14  Wis - 13  **Con - 15  *note- John's hand-eye coordination is about 17, but his lowered Dex score is due to my perception of his agility. **note- Jim's constitution might seem high for most people that know him on and off.  He's not a big guy that can take alot of damage type of thing... sheer will power and determination after he has chosen to put his Coors light down and get off his ass though...
Wahoooo!  Bought my ticket to Amsterdam.  Leaving the 6th and flying back on the 9th.  Not long, but it should be fun anyway.  I'm meeting Rob.... can't wait.  I move into a new pad in "Didsbury", (That's the correct way to spell it.) on the outskirt of Manchester... heavy student area.  I move in on the 1st so I might be off-line until I get things set up.   Going to be a busy early June.  I've been convinced to shave my head this weekend.  Tres european, but I'm going to look like a freak with the amount of times I've been hit in the head.  Maybe it will give me the tough guy look I always have been lacking to pick up the chicks.  If not, I suppose I have enough money to cover that problem in Amsterdam.
A  pound in your hand means something.   Lesser change doesn't quite do it; but a quid in the palm makes you feel like "shit, I can have this or that." It's a very solid coin.
I just witnessed a magpie making noice on the ground in front of a cheshire cat, sitting on a fence.  It was strutting in front of the cat that I have seen eat 2 of his offspring.  What feeling is that? It's not revenge.  It's not regret.  It's pride.  And I think I have never seen a "fuck you" so well displayed in all my life.   I loved it, and I'm not quite sure why.
You go  urlLink Bill !  It seems as though, and I know I don't know you well enough to say this but, it seems as though you are outside of the game my friend.  You needed it.
I've found a little section of life around Manchester's outskirts that reminds me of Little Five Points from Atlanta.  Not exactly, but I believe this will be where my home will be.  Ditsbury...I didn't spell that right, but I'll correct it later.
I really felt what  urlLink Liz  said yesterday.  Is the Fishtanque becoming self-aware?
alright... I'm falling in love with this R.E.M. album me... It's just like old R.E.M. albums that I slowly fell in love with me....me...me...me....  why not?  why?  I don't know.  It's just happening.... it's different from past R.E.M. albums, but that same slow love affair that grows more with familiarity and listening... listen... grow... me.  I hated it... I hated it's slow forced melodies... I find me after a while of it.... me... why?   I don't want my music to be that... so?  who cares... I don't have to be that... My friend is still there though.  I am still watching and listening to every friend the same way... doesn't matter how different... I'm still watching and I like.
Kudos is due Mr. Jeffords for his righteous separation from the right!
urlLink Sean  - I wish I knew more about the Manchester music scene, but I've been staying in a house way out in the suburbs and I haven't seen much of anything but English T.V. since I've been here.  I'm moving out to a satelite city of Manchester called Altrincham on June 1st, so I hope to experience a bit more of the night life.  I haven't heard the name Joy Division in a while.  I can't say that I know much about them.  When I think of Joy Division, I think of a mix between the Clash and Velvet Underground.  (I may be way off there)  I'll certainly post my music scene findings as soon as I experience them.  I'm hoping that I will have alot more to post about after a month or so of getting set up in my new pad.
Two songs that are growing on me from Reveal:   urlLink Saturn Returns  and  urlLink Chorus and the Ring .  I know I said it all sucks, but I'm not listening to me anyway.
Did I get your ass right, John?
Virtual model of John after a month of his new routine.
Great news for me... I just got my visa and papers that have been swirling around the governmental offices of the U.K. for a while.  I'm legit now until November of 2002.  Yeeeeeeeha!!!
I watched this really cool BBC program on Lake Vostok today.  Apparently they have found that life has survived for millions of years in microbial form, not by photosynthesis, but chemosynthesis (hydrogen sulfide more specifically) that is usually given off from heat vents that well up inner earth gases.  They also talked about a cave system that was teaming with insect life (all brand new species) that had been shut off from any contact from the surface (no light, or rain water or anything) for millions of years.  The whole ecosystem fed off of microbes that used chemosynthesis.  What makes me mention all this is the fact that I am totally consumed with astrobiology these days or at least the prospects of it.  Europa with it's deep water oceans under 4 miles of ice could be teaming with life.  Thank goodness there are dedicated scientists to do all the dirty work while I can just sit down for 30 minutes and watch a video about it.  By the way, I've put little pictures with colored splotches (not a very artistic way of doing it, but it works) next to the stories on the main drunkenfish page.  At the moment, all the pictures have red ovals which means that the newest chapter of that particular story is old.  Yellow means less than six months and green means that they have been created less than one month ago.  Maybe somehow I will be inspired to see some more green splotches... we'll see.  As always, I would be extremely eager to get the first chapter of a story from anyone.  My mom sent me an email thanking me for my contribution to her burgundy flowering plant for Mother's Day.  Ummm.... I suppose I should call each of my brothers to find and thank the responsible party.  In my defense, Mother's Day is celebrated on a different day here in England... I still don't think that would fly with my mom though.
I screwed up somehow, or my dreamweaver did, or something funky happened when I synchronized my site with the server... anyway, the drunkenfish page I designed is gone... no big deal I suppose, I'll just redo it.  R.E.M's new album sucks royal!  I have to admit, to me a band is a friend and it is always hard to let go of good friends when they have changed too much to be around anymore.  I've given R.E.M chances, but Up and Reveal are too far gone to continue my relationship with them.  Good bye old friend... I love you.  Coming soon in June will be my "Mars Blog"  A journal from my granddaughter Laika in the year 2066.
urlLink Sonya?   ...damn!
There was an error in Regan's webpage that was preventing her posts from going live.  Along with the correction, I have put up some of her poems on her site.   urlLink Check it out.
I just can't send Regan to the Malebloge... not yet.  I ask of thee that thouest save poor doomed Regan for just a short while.  Thus now I ponder the eternal question (besides that "who am I?" crap).  Can a soul survive and return to the living after the torture of... THE MALEBLOGE!  Bwah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...  We'll see.
urlLink "That wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'."  I hear ya brother Bill.  Praise be, my Perry, praise be.
I hear your name thrown around all the time and you've been on Ned's blogger list (without even having a blog) for ages.  Welcome Phil!
The Babel Fish is small, yellow, leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds off of brainwave energy, and as a by-product, excretes telepathically, the intended meanings. The outcome of which is that if you stick a Babel Fish in your ear, you can instantly understand anything said to you, in any language.  The Babel Fish is, or rather was, the centre of a major controversy. The chances of anything so mind-bogglingly useful evolving by chance can be considered a positive proof of the existence of God. This causes other, greater problems.  As God will refuse to prove that he exists, as proof denies faith, and without faith He is nothing, He is confronted with a problem. The Babel Fish is a dead giveaway - it proves that He exists, and therefore He doesn't! God was reported to have vanished in a puff of logic at that point.  As the Babel Fish is now widely available from any convenient Sirius Cybernetics Corporation 'Babel Fish Dispenser Aquarium', most of the population of the galaxy have one poking in their ear. Thus, the Babel Fish has effectively removed all language barriers, and has consequently allowed so much more to be communicated; it has caused more, and bloodier wars than anything in the history of creation.
..so long and thanks for all the fish, Mr. Adams.
gosh... have you ever written something really stupid, only to have blogger go down on you (like the crack slut bitch whore she is... but damn do I still love her) before you can delete it?    I spent the last 4 hours in nervous panic trying to get rid of my last post.  whew, it's gone!
Happy Birthday Jimmy Stewart!!!!  Wish I had some comprimising photos to post, but alas I'm in strict contract to certain media corporations to not display those pictures until it is in the best intrests of invested parties as to make a reasonable profit from such a posting.  I wish you would quit fucking around and get famous already.
John- your ring is in the bathroom or the bedroom.
Heather - I was a mess when a death occured suddnely early in my adult life.  I don't know how I would react now.  I remember the shock and the feel of something ripped away without warning and feeling like, damn, that's not suppose to happen.  At the time, it also put me into a deep depression on a personal level because I realized my mortality and how my number could be up at any second and it also unleashed alot of other built up repressed feelings of my own.  I would like to think that I would be less selfish in my suffering now, but it's hard to tell until you experience it.  Anyway, I wish you the best in trying to cope with the feelings that make sense, like in honoring your friend, but also in those thoughts and feelings that don't.
Hello and welcome Regan!  Be sure to check out those hipsters over at Tanque.org.  They're extremely friendly people and I'm sure you'll have lots in common to talk about.
I've wanted to put out the 7th chapter of Crunch the Wonder Dog for some time now, but I've just not been into it enough... I feel I let Crunch down in the 6th, by not being enthusiastic enough with the story.  I know he is a made up dog, but I love 'em and I just don't want to let his spirit down again.  I've scraped the beginnings of 3 such 7th chapters because all I had down was the logistics of the situation, just like I did in the 6th.  hmmmmm....  I guess there is no need to rush a good rush.  If the 7th comes to me in a rush, like all of the best chapters I've written, then I'll put it up.  What I want to write about is Melody Howl, even though the story sucks... Maybe I should just follow my whims and keep writing Melody Howl in the disregard part of the main drunkenfish page to get me past this hump in writing.  I should probably be writing this babble in the drunkenbattleblog considering my condition, but it doesn't really fit there either.  Blah, blah, blah... The Fortress of the Vampire will probably be coming soon for Melody Howl.
Like the site Jimmy Stewart!
some mars calender points of interests...  1. every unit of time will be 1.0275 times longer than its terrestrial counterpart, but we will use the same named units and structure.  2. The martian year is 669 martian days.  3. Since mars has an elliptical orbit, its seasons are of unequal length with 66 martian days in Leo (Leo 24 being aphelion 'farthest away from the sun') to 46 martian days in Aquarius (Aquarius 16 being perihelion "nearest to the sun')  4.  The dust storm season on mars starts in Capricorn and last until Aries.  Dust storms are caused by carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere from the melting frozen antarctic during the relative hot southern spring and summer (it's much closer to the sun than the rest of the year) creating the atmospheric pressure of the planet to raise about 12 percent in the course of a few months. This causes the high wind dust storms that start at the south pole and spread north throughout the southern summer season, sometimes engulfing the entire planet.
This is kinda cool to me.  This is the mars calender that will most likely be used by martian colonists.  Each zodiac sign represents the position of mars as viewed from the sun, so at midnight during that zodiac month, that constellation should be straight overhead.  If you put a penny on the diamond of a year of the outer circle (mars calender) and then put another penny on the 1st of January in the inner circle (earth calender) and then move them together one diamond at a time counterclockwise, you can determine the alignment of earth and mars at a certain time of year and the corresponding calender dates.
Whew... that was a much needed break.  I feel better now.  heh,heh...  I've been having dreams for about a month now on corporate media conglomerates.  The first one happened out of no where.... I wasn't even aware of any developing situation.  It was about my local newspaper in New Orleans buying up all the other newspapers in the States, one by one, and I was getting all worked up explaining to my family what was so horrible about that.  I woke up and turned on my computer that has the NYTimes as my front page.  Lo and behold the lead story was about the FCC loosening restrictions on corporate media expansion.  Anyway, it shocked me enough to feel a certain obligation in pursuing the subject, so I'm following my subconscious and posting links to articles when I run across them until the dreams stop or I lose interest, which ever comes last.  I haven't had whole dreams on the subject since the first one, but it just keeps  popping up in conversations throughout my dreams.    urlLink "If the flow of human communications is controlled by global media companies, how do we ensure that social and cultural points of view and political expressions that may differ from those of the companies who own the frequencies will be allowed to flow over the spectrum?"
Good - Happy Birthday Shari and David !!!   Welcome Heather !!!  Bad - My blog has been absolutely boring lately.  There is so much positive energy going on in this here bloggin' group, but I'm not a very positive person at the moment.  I'm going to take an unknown amount of time off from blogging, until I get an attitude change.  If anyone needs anything let me know.  My e-mail is on the battleblog and main drunkenfish page.  Ta.
I don't have the time to make a proper posting because I am on someone elses computer, but I just wanted to give my deepest sympathy to John for the death of his mom, and also to Rob Corwin for the death of his father.  I should be back online by mid July.   I miss reading from you all.
Moving Day!!!  I can't wait... Chris and Bridget and Sophie Lea have been extremely good hosts and have made me feel very comfortable living with them.  The business has had some unavoidable delays, so things haven't moved as fast as I would have wanted them, but hey, that's life.  June for me is going to be Flash, Flash, and possibly some more Flash.  The company start day is now set at mid-July.  Actually, although I would have liked to have been independent and rakin' in some money by now, it's probably best that things went this way.  The delays have allowed me the time to practice skills, get a better understanding of the competition here and what our company's direction is likely to be, legally get me set up to do things in a proper fashion instead of under the table, and enjoy a cool oppurtunity to hang with and learn from the Lea family.  I'm going to be offline for awhile until I get everything functioning in the new pad.  I feel like I've finally arrived in England today.
Sorry, I know it's rude to make such nondescriptive posts like that, but I was really tired and just wanted to say something before I went to sleep for the next 24 hrs or so.  It was just a psychodelic experience basically, where the dosage was just a little too high for me.  My main fondness of the vacation was sitting with Rob at the cafes during the day, people watching and discussing the past, present, and future.  Shrooming has been tons of fun in the past, but a gram of Hawaiian is apparently too much for me these days to handle myself out in public.  I was suppose to hang with Rob until his train left, but I couldn't make it and opted for a cab ride back to the safety of my hotel room.  It was probably a terrible thing to leave a friend in that condition at a train station, but it really wasn't a choice for me at that moment.  Anyway, I made it back to the the hotel room safe and sound and within the hour Rob showed up again because he missed his train.  I was really glad actually that he made it back because I was in major guilt from leaving him there and I wanted to say "sorry".  He actually managed to reschedule his train in that condition and everything... I was proud of him because I couldn't have tied my shoes.  It was a long, long night after that without any sleep at all, with voices swirling around my head in foreign languages and jumps through various memories, and a stomach that wouldn't quit torturing me.  The night before the shrooms I was mugged walking home.  I wasn't hurt, but my pants were ripped off from the six guys who attacked me and my wallet with everything that legally makes me, me was taken.  The most embarrassing part was having to wave down a cab in my underwear and ask for a ride, even though I didn't have any money.  The cabby was very generous.  Anyway, I didn't think I was going to tell that part of the story, but I guess there it is.  I believe that it sent my thoughts in a bad direction during the next night of shrooms which aided in my inability to handle being out in public in an altered state.  The good thing is that I left my passport in my suitcase, so I didn't have any problems getting home.  Last night, back in England,  I woke up and there were hands reaching around the corner of my bedroom door throwing butterflies and flies into my room.  It really scared me until I realized that hallucinations are part of the game with shrooms (even though it was the next day)  The metaphor I guess is pretty clear to me.  I hope that was the last night of shit like that though.
Well, I met up with Rob in Amsterdam.  All I can really say about the trip was that it was damn good to see Rob.   We chose the red pills and ended up much further down the rabbit hole than expected.  It was a strange trip indeed, but somehow we survived it.  Na zdorowie, Rob!
- Congrats Clint! - Happy Birthday Liz! - I'm glad to hear you're back to work Phil.  It's always more fun to ball your meat than to let your meat loaf.  (Quote was borrowed from a recent Jim S. post which was quoted from something John said I believe... anyway, I just wanted to say meat loaf too.) -love the spicy scale, Sean.  Everything hot should have to include that on it's labeling.
I'm sitting in the world's biggest internet Cafe.  easyEverything!  Looks like about 10,000 terminals in here.  Well, as suspected I cannot find Rob anywhere.  We could have done this whole thing different, but what the hell, I'm in Amsterdam and having fun by myself.  Went to a few bars last night and tried to mingle with the locals.  Everyone I've met so far (that's about 5 total) has been really cool.  There's nothing like a trip to Holland to make you feel real unedumacated.  Even the beggars speak several languages  (There's quite a few of them around actually.)  I gave a bum 5 G yesterday and he gave me a piece of paper with his internet site on social and economic conditions of Europe.  That's http://www.geocities.com/eurodos for those interested. This is a city of beautiful young women, riding bikes.  It's like finding the secret valley of the butterflies or something... They're everywhere... (women on bicycles, I mean)  Well, my intention is to hit the museums today and go a little nutty tonight with some sort of self-indulgence.  I'm at the Linda hotel, just in case Rob reads this.
I leave for Amsterdam in 4 hours.  Cheap flights pick fun hours for travel.  I'm going to be dead sleepy when I get there.  The place I'd like to stay at has an internet cafe, so I should have no problem making a post or two from there.  After I get back, I will be moving and trying to set up my ADSL in the new pad, so I might be offline for awhile. (my guess is a couple of weeks, but who knows.)  Meeting up with Rob in Amsterdam is going to be difficult.  I tried to get him interested in starting a hotmail account so we could communicate on the net, but he didn't go for it.  Instead we're going with my mobile phone, but I really have no idea if it is going to work there or not.  It might just be me alone for three days, oh well.
I first met Ned when I was in 7th grade.  I had just newly joined Troop 131 of the BSA and I found myself sitting in a corner a little scared because I didn't know anyone.  Ned came up and introduced himself and let me hang out with him.  I remember being so relieved.  I could easily have gone months without talking to a single person.  No offense to Rob (cause I love 'em too) who was in the same troop, but he never paid attention to me at all until he figured out that I could be a dungeon master for him.  It's a good first memory of Ned as being a selfless, generous person.
Well, the system prevails.  My problem with dealing with the property management company yesterday was my concept of "they".  When I switched from talking with the person I was dealing with to the department's manager, my situation was completely different.  The manager, after my explanation of the situation,  was extremely helpful and said that she would return a portion of the fee for the application and said the remainder was for their efforts in setting me up and contacts to the landlord and that she would look into checking my U.S. credit and that most likely she could wave the need for a Guarantor.  Cool huh.  You have to be speaking with the right person to get things done properly.  Live and learn.
Heidi - um.... what John said.  It might not be original, but I feel the same way.  I don't correspond with you much, but I always read your posts and I think you are a very positive influence for me.  I wish you the best of birthdays.  By the way, you have a very bright yellow aura.  I can tell, even though I've never met you.  Cheers.  Clay, John, Ned - Sorry my memory doesn't go back that far anymore.  All I remember from the moody blues concert was John pouring a beer into the Sangria on the back of the truck and everyone getting pissed off.  I remember Clay carefully explaining to John, as if he were a child, why he shouldn't have poured that beer in there.  I faintly remember not being able to get into the venue for the concert and hanging out near a gazebo type of thing and listening to the music from afar.  That's about it.  Anyway, I'm sure I had fun.  Don't remember who all was there besides those two.  I do have to mention though that I think we, meaning Clay and I, went to more than one moody blues concert and thereby may have had two separate adventures; one with John, one with Ned.. or maybe two with both... I hope this helped us all understand... I'll shut up now.  Jim S. - Sorry, I didn't say it before... Congrats on the new job!  I've not said much because it's just typical Jim.  Keep on conquering my friend.  Liz, Heather - Kewlllll....  urlLink new domain for Liz,  and for  urlLink Heather .  Jim A. - You're such a good dude.  I know the drunkenfish is a wild unpredictable beast, but you stay in spirit always and I am very appreciative.  Thank you.  Through trial and error, eventually we'll get some posters who actually stay... you'll see.  Also I'd like to say, "damn, that is a cute baby... are you sure there wasn't some kind of mix up at the hospital?"  Amos - I probably shouldn't chime in here, because I don't have any suggestions, but I'm looking for a sci-fi writer with the same convictions as Ursula LeGuin (sp?) in fantasy.  I've never found them.  It all seems to turn into soap opera crap that could be placed anywhere in time.  I guess my suggestion, out of ignorance of what is around now, is to go back to Issac Asimov or David Niven.  Someone, help me find good sci-fi, please.  Amy - Whoa!  is that Motor Girrrrrrl going  urlLink pink ?  Kinda girrly isn't it?  I'm just giving you shit 'cause you said you'd be changing it soon.  Sonya - Love the art.  At first I thought it was a photograph and then I had to look at it a sec and I thought, wow... what a powerful view of visual CBD perspective.  Ben - I had one of those deep but painfully simplistic dreams last night, that I was crying and my mom came up to me and asked why I was crying.  I said, "It's nothing, it's stupid really, it's not worth telling you."  She said, "C'mon tell me, what was it?"  I said, "For some strange reason, I'm feeling distressed from the thought of how much pain has been distributed throughout the human race throughout time because of pure ignorance and lack of communication."  She smiled and said to me "I know what your feeling.  It's all true and you should know that feeling, but don't dwell on it.  It doesn't help you to dwell on that."   Well, I woke up.  Not much of a dream, but somehow I awakened feeling extremely naive and lost in the world and it took me a few minutes and a cup of coffee to feel more in touch (or less, not sure).  Just thought I'd share. (I'm not trying to be deep here, I'm just telling the dream as it happened.)  I've been off balance all day.  I talked to Chris today at a Cafe about some personal things in life that troubled me, but I didn't really feel like it was me telling him this.  I was wandering somewhere above, looking down, and thinking "is this real?"  I didn't feel connected to my voice.  I'm not a teen-ager, he doesn't want to hear my bullshit.  Am I growing old enough to know that my problems are trivial or am I just realizing that sometimes I just talk to hear myself talk?  I really don't know.  Anyway, I used to feel better after confiding in others, but now I just get this really empty feeling that takes me a day or two to shrug off.
urlLink Sean  - Tenacious D rocks!  So that's how it's done... thanks, Jack Black.
I'm finding that Web Design entails alot of script writing.  Duh... Why can't it just be about playing with pretty colors and inserting stolen pictures from the web...  You mean you want your page to actually do something?  Shit.  I suppose it will get easier as we develop a library of these things over time.  Hopefully, my lack of Java knowledge will improve as I bungle through simple scripts with the help of Chris.  I'm sure I'll be crusin' the net, stealing whatever I can find that's close to what I need to make happen.  sigh...  I wonder if Pizza Hut is hiring.
urlLink Amos  - that's the intro to a song called Pinkeye from Ween's "The Mollusk".  I thought it sounded drunkenfishy enough to be the drunkenfish theme.   urlLink Clay  - Welcome Bro!  I told everyone of your appearance before but it was at the very end of a long day of posting so I don't know if anyone read down that far.   urlLink Ernie  - I don't know you, but welcome to the drunkenfish.  A friend of Jim Stewart is a friend of mine.  I'll try to get some links up to your page sometime today.  Clay and Ernie - Be sure to check out  urlLink The Tanque .  Otherwise, the posting might seem a little confusing.  Besides.... it's just great reading material.
urlLink Beautiful baby!!!
I've disconnected my setihome link on the main drunkenfish page because a gambling page has taken it over.   I can't think of anything to combat it, so I'm just getting rid of the link until it comes back legit.  I e-mailed a couple of possible interested parties.  That's all I can think to do.
Well, I'm venturing into unknown land by inviting my beloved brother into the drunkenfish.  I hope he stays with us.  Welcome,  urlLink Clay .
Shit, I didn't get much done today work wise.  Cruisin' through insurance company webpages to get an idea on what I should do in designing one.  On the otherhand though the Drunkenfish had a productive day.  Had a blast reading on the  urlLink drunkenbattleblog.
urlLink Check this out , Rob Corwin was just in a cool art show.
urlLink Hang in there George Harrison .  It's been a rough decade for that man.  When John Lennon died, Will Sibley and I spent weeks trying to show each other that we were bigger Lennon fans than the other by acting out a constant state of depression.  I remember being truly hurt, but I was also aware that I was putting on a little more of a performance than was needed for the oscar.
urlLink Amos  - Ethniklashistan is finally a solution from the U.N. that goes beyond the desires of the countries in power and focuses on the need for peace and stablity in our world.  Oh yeah, and Amos, I just received a letter from President Bush saying he was going to send me a check for 300 bucks.  Well, God bless President Bush!  I always liked that guy.
urlLink John  sent me some pictures the other day of him and his wife and "the unknown man" out in the bright light, beach, palm trees, etc... I'm thinking, cool, vacation pictures, but I keep forgeting he lives there.  That's an everyday thing.  Must be nice.  ( Am I subconsciously pitching Florida again... what's with me?  Maybe it's because here in beautiful Manchester England I haven't seen that yellow thingy in a while, what did they use to call it... oh yeah, THE SUN!!!)   By the way  urlLink John , loved the nanotech articles.  It makes one go wildly into futuristic tangents of thought.  I think though that they are being a little misleading by talking about the very beginnings of the technology research happening within a decade and then without any reference of time, leaping to what nanotechnology, to my understanding of it, won't happen for another hundred years.  One can envision dropping a drop of fluid from an eyedropper on top of a skyscraper (steel, ceramics, copper, glass, silicon, etc... ) and in that drop would contain thousands of tiny robotic assemblers, half of which are programed specifically to assemble more assemblers.  What armed monster robotic army from hell, all carrying little vials of this fluid, could be formed from that.  Probably one plenty big enough to take over airports and other transportation centers nearby to spread out through the world fairly quickly.  yeeeeshhh!  I know that's a pretty limited vision of nanotechnology, but hey, it's fun day dreaming about it.
alright, I'm starting to miss my daily Ned blog.  Where has our hero wandered off to?  Everyone needs their moment of peace and relaxation, but I'm a selfish person who needs his Ned fix!  Ok... breath Ben.... Ned is a real person who needs the same things as you and everybody else does.... whewwwwwww... ok... I accept your absence Ned.... I'm ok with that.
There's really no mercy in the word mercenary, is there?   urlLink Look at what the new nazi party is up to now .  What are we allowing to happen?  Can we honestly condemn the Germans for not seeing what was going on?  Hopefully we can, and we'll change this before we are too deep in the shit. The domestic problems of this country should be handled within this country.  We can't bully the world into solving our problems.  Bush really is scaring me.  Who is responsible for keeping his actions under control... us?  Shit... how do we do that?  It seems we've given him a free four year pass to play our system for everything he wants out of it.  He's a crazy man.  How do we impeach him before he does too much damage?
Cletus, grow up, will ya... You can't stay in mommy your entire childhood.  Perhaps that may mean losing some of your comforts, but that's life.  Welcome to the real world.
I get these patties out of a box and throw them on the grill.  The front of the package says contains select cuts of 100% Beef, and of course the 100% Beef inside a picture of a blue ribbon is huge.  So I'm thinking, cool... until I bite into it.  Jesus!  This can't be real beef.  I flip the package over and see the multitude of ingredients.  I flip back to the front and notice the word "contains" suddenly has a slightly different meaning to me.  Bastards!
Sounding like I was pitching Florida there in yesterday's blog, but mainly I was just thinking of my dog.  I'm on the wagon from booze and cigs.  We'll see how long that lasts.  Gotta shake up the old physical body and rejuvinate the soul every now and then.  I think that if I could drink without smoking then I would never smoke again.  Unfortunately...
I used to live in a house... in florida... a sanctuary in the middle of an urban wasteland... with my dog Louie.   damn, what I would give to be back there now.  Sorry, just remembering a nice moment in my life.  I move on.
Some notes on Mars Blog: I knew when I started that this was a little too involved of a project than I was willing to put the effort in for, but I went ahead with it anyway, because, what the hell, it's only a blog.  Not too much lost if I give up or fail.  Jim S. has hinted at wanting to keep a  character journal on the same blog as Laika.  I would very much like other writers on the Mars Blog.  I'm afraid that if I just write it by myself that it will disappear in a month or so.  Some guidelines, actually the only guideilines, is that I'd like to keep it believable.  (Even though I'm hinting in my last post of a martian ecosystem beneath the surface, that doesn't necessarily mean that will happen.)  Major issues that would affect everyone, should probably be bounced around a little first.)  Also the writing should have a reason for being on Mars.  I would rather not have a Deep Space Nine on my hands that is just a soap opera that could be just as easily in Beverly Hills instead of Mars.  That all said, anyone who wants to start up their own character is cool with me to give it a shot for as long as they want to keep it up.  If you want your character in a different city, career... all that's probably preferable, but I'd like to at least keep the time and dates for posts sychronized somewhat.  I'll send a copy of the number of days in each month and an explanation of time units on Mars for those who are interested in writing. Basically you can look at the date and just add one day if you are posting on the next day in our time.  It sounds like a huge effort to get involved in, but no love will be lost for anyone who starts and quits or writes incredibly bad or anything.  The readers don't have to know who is writing what character story either.  It will be your show, it's just for fun.  I hope some take me up on the offer.
Wow, Heidi.  I haven't heard the name Will Sibley in ages.  I used to hang out at his house everyday from about 5th grade to 7th.  We made an awful movie together and formed my first rock band where we mainly would just pose and mimic the Beatles.  My parents finally baned me from seeing him because we played hooky from school in 7th and got drunk on Gin and orangejuice and rode the bed matresses down the stairs all day at his place.  I'm not sure who told on me in that scenario, but even if it was Will, I forgive him.  I had gotten away with it scott free until the Principal called my mom three days later.  Cheers to Will, an old friend.
I've grown to love all the black and white movies they show on T.V. here.  There's always some character with a silver flask, who always offers it to the hero.  Some movies the hero takes a swig, others he politely declines.  Just an uninteresting observation, I thought I'd pass on.  By the way, Chris Hill, everyone here calls shopping carts, trolleys.  I guess that makes everyday kind of funny in that way for me.  I'm just casually wandering around in random fashion with today's post.  A "cowboy" here is a hack.  Took me a little while to figure that out, because it's very common to use the expression in commercials.  Speaking of commercials, has anyone seen my favorite commercial of all times.  It's a new Guiness ad shown here in Britain called The Dream Club Ad.  Damn, I love that commercial.  One last random note of pleasure, I told my Plumber as he was walking out the door to "have a good one."  He paused in confusion for a second and then said with a smile, "Oh... right, Cheerio!"
flies... I don't know what to make of 'em.  part of me want's to kill 'em.  part of me wants to understand 'em. part of me wants to understand them and then slowly torture them into reality. I don't think that's too heathy an attitude.  just a thought.
I love Jim and John so much sometimes it hurts.  ok... I have to ruin it by saying that I'm drunk, but what are you going to do about it.
Strange days indeed, most peculiar mama.  Maybe it was just my hangover, but I walked around the streets today with a psychic mind from hell.  Every person I saw came a flood of information about that person.  I'm guessing that it was all my imagination, but I felt as though I could see everyone for real.  Strange indeed.  An old man strolling along with his overloaded walker, full of groceries was walking next to me.  At first, I felt pity, then I noticed he was jamming out with headphones to bob dylan.  A whole wave of thought enveloped me.  He had a smile on his face.  I looked around and I saw a girl holding the hand of another girl and I noticed that she held a poster in her hand and that they were shopping together and were having fun.  I started to look at all the people around me and realized I could tell a lot from just looking at them.  All these people were, when it comes down to it, a lot like me.  I had to just sit down on a wall and watch for a while.  Why haven't I noticed this before?  Maybe I've been a self-centered bastard all my life.  Don't know...  I seemed to be able to make up whole lives around all the people that I saw.  Probably, way too much assuming, but it made all of these people real to me.  Suddenly, I was not alone at all in this world.  I could see the pain, joy, boredom, rage in all these people by casual observation.  I'm still piecing all this together, but I can't explain what a revelation this morning was to me.  I'm afraid this only shows my narrow tunnel vision I've had all my life, but I thought I'd relate the feeling somehow.  anyway, I'm going to head off to the library again.  I hope these thoughts don't turn into some bad acid trip kinda thing, because they feel intense to me.  I hope it's just me growing up and that this particular feeling is just a natural human evolution thing that happens to everyone.
Sorry Jim, I just couldn't take it any longer with the 3's company theme.  I'm just not man enough.
I've invited an old friend, Chris Hill, to join in on the drunkenfish fun, but as always I don't expect much posting because he is in the Navy and doesn't have the time to post regularly.  Anyway, he's up and can post when he likes.
Well, I can't think of five albums I lick drunken wounds on, maybe it would be easier to think of 5 albums I listen to that I don't lick drunken wounds to.  I listen to the white album definitely, and pink floyd's wish you were here, and R.E.M.'s Green, and Moody Blues' To our Children's Children's Children, although that seems a bit sappy musically.  I guess to round that off I listen to John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band.  Here are 5 songs that I've stolen from Napster that I tend to gravitate toward when I'm drunk as well.  urlLink 1. SpaceShip - Sean Lennon   urlLink 2. Girl From the North Country - Bob Dylan   urlLink 3. Uncle Albert - Paul McCartney   urlLink 4. Given To Fly - Pearl Jam   urlLink 5. Baby Bitch - Ween
Sean - It's been on the news here that the conservative party is advocating the legalization of marijuana to separate it from the element of crime.  Their philosophy, which makes sense to me, is that marijuana only leads to harsher drugs like heroin if the people who buy the pot have to buy it from the criminals who also are involved in other illegal sales of drugs.  The conservative party?  I don't get it, and am just assumming that either I'm just dreaming or that it is some desparate Tory scheme to recapture the youth vote.
Ughhhh!!!!  Jimmy has hacked the main Drunkenfish page song!  I'll leave it up for a while 'cause I'm still laughing at it.
Well, I finally get back online and blogger is down.  Damn.  I'll publish later I suppose.  Man, it is good to be back.  I can't believe I went more than a month without the internet.  Did I learn new and exciting activities while I couldn't play on the net?  No!!!  I sat in my chair and stared at my computer in disgust the entire time.  I'll try to start up the Mars Blog today and write in some excuse for why it has taken so long for our hero Laika to get there.  Alot happened while I was gone, and I'll try to read back on some of it, but I'm sure alot of it will just have to be missed.  I haven't started reading yet, but I'll start tonight. My company hasn't started yet, but the pieces are coming together now and everyone is back from vacation so I'm starting to get excited.  Soon, I could be actually working again.  Never thought I wanted to work, but I am soooo bored that I trully would like to get started.  I'm starting to see a little more of England now.  I've been hanging out at the public library these days, because without money, that's the only place I can think of to hang out away from my apartment.  Anyway, good to be back.
Cool LOTR movie pic.  It's not a painting.  You can really see that the artists from all the LOTR calenders they used to put out have an influence in the movie design.   urlLink Here's a site with a bunch of them.
Whoa!  JimS., I forgot about Bob and Pete.  (The Roaches in Fat City)  In reality we didn't just have two roaches, one named Bob and one named Pete.  Roaches don't actually come in pairs like that of course.  There were hundreds of those cute little guys.  We just called anyone we saw that was lean and mean, Pete, and the fat and slower ones, Bob.  Since John and I both slept on the floor, it was easier to handle their presence by pretending they were pets.  You'd wake up in the middle of the night and see right in front of your eye this big roach with long antennae feeling all around and instead of screaming, you'd say, "Hey Bob!", with a loving smile.  Then one would dart across your toes and you'd say, "My, my, aren't we fiesty tonight Pete... Goodnight boys, gotta big day tomorrow so I have to try to go back to sleep.  Have fun!"
JimS.- I realize you said take these facts with a grain, but just for interest's sake I believe the fourth closest star is Banard's Star and it's only about 6 light years away, meaning you would only see 6 years into Earth's past.  I think.  I love the facts spread though.  I've always wanted to know the speed stuff, but never got around to looking it up.  Cool. I love that shit.  John - What can I say?  I think of you often.  Happy Birhtday, my friend!!!  Let's see here, I've already told the story about how we met in the restroom at highschool and you introduced yourself by playing your drumsticks on the urinal while I was taking a pee and you asked me to join your band with Dale Bryant.  I thought you were a freak then, and I still do now.  I should be able to come up with some John story I haven't told a million times.  There's a bunch of police stories I know, like drunkenly falling down the escalator in front of the policeman, and drunk driving a van across a golf course with a bunch of police cars chasing you at an amazing 15 mph until you drove into a sand trap, and losing your job at the carwash when you forgot to lift a lever and knocked the cherries of a police car...  Well, I digress.  There are too many of those kind of stories to tell and besides, that's all behind you.  There's plenty of drunken stories like, Fat city brawls, the gay nightclub in West Palm, the hot tub incident in Carmel... nevermind... I can't do that to you.  ...and you might resort to an eye for an eye.  How about a few good locational memories?   The kitchen in Fat City where The Great Condiment War started, where the linoleum drunken water slide was created, where we hung all of our cool artwork.                                                                     The band room in Muncie,  where you slept with your head on the pillow in your bass drum, where we finally realized the extent of Jimmy's morning grumpiness when he visited once, where we played Revolution for             Lisa McMullen, where we had countless parties and wrote many songs.  O.K. all that was just for John's memory, but here's a story about John. Don't worry John it's not about the cancer/jockitch mix-up that you went to the hospital for either.  Actually it's not a ha ha story.  It's not even a single event story.  It's kinda sappy sentiment.  It's an observation about John that changed my life completely.  I was always concerned throughout my young adulthood about whether I was good enough to be friends with this or that person or were they good enough to be hanging around me.  I had this whole level system going through my head.  I used to watch John hang around and have serious discussions with people I considered trash.  I saw it as a huge flaw of John's.  I didn't realize what emotion I was perpetuating constantly about these people.  It was hate.  I never bothered actually talking to people to find out about their true character.  As time went on and I had more and more life lessons of my own, I discovered that John had always been a saint with strangers.  He just seemed to learn that hate wasn't worth it very early on in his life.  My level system has almost, but not completely, dissolved by now and it's been a liberating concept for me.  I have to say that observing John's empathetic behavior towards others throughout my lifetime has made me a much better person.  Thank you John.  P.S.  If any gorgeous women got all choked up about that last paragraph, my e-mail is mindevol@hotmail.com.  I would love to get together and discuss it in person.
Amy - I just explored your links and took a look at your friend Melissa's blog and she says she's dreaming about throwing things around, breaking things, and hanging out with you.  With you dreaming about earthquakes, maybe you two share a common situation that has slipped into both of your subconsiousness.
This weekend I was at Chris's throwing the football (american) around and a Limey named Ian actually went to that so often talked about place that I've defended in my mind a million times over.  The American Football Player is a wimp for wearing pads thing.  It went something like this.  Ian :  "Have you ever heard about or seen English Rugby?"  Ben:  "Yeah, but I haven't seen it much on T.V since I've been here.  Is it out of season?"  Ian :  "Yeah, Cricket is being played alot now on T.V.  Rugby is a little like American Football, but it's a little rougher of a game.  They don't wear pads like in American football."  Ben:  I wanted to smile, nod my head, and politely say, "yeah...yeah... So I've heard."   but what instead came out of my mouth was.  "Yeah, I'd like to see what would happen if an average American 350 lbs defensive guard met an average 180 lbs English Rugby player in an ally."  Ian :  "Then the American Football player would definitely need his pads."  Ben :  "I think the pads are used in American Football because the players would die if they hit each other with the force that they do.  I guess frolicking around on the grassy field with your pretty colored, pulled up socks and your shiny silk shorts is enough to protect you from an English Rugby hit."  Ian :  He said something that everyone laughed at after that, but it didn't matter to me because I didn't hear it.  I was already reveling over my cleverness in a dream-like trance of pride.  So, I might have lost the arguement.  I don't know, but at least I convinced myself that American Football is rougher than English Rugby.    I don't even watch sports.  I have no idea what I was trying to accomplish.
Welcome Brad and Mitch!  Enjoy the Blogging experience and be sure to discover Tanque.org.  These are the folks that most of our dialog is with.  If either of you like to do any creative writing, I've tried to keep it a theme of the Drunkenfish.  Currently there are only three projects in the queue.  1. The Mars Blog - Create your own character in the year 2066 and keep a journal of this person's activities in a martian colony.  2. The DrunkenBattleBlog - whenever the urge strikes you to write in a drunken state, you can have at it.  It has become more recently used for the day after, but there are no rules.  3. Stories on the main Drunkenfish page - Currently it's just pieces of my stories, but this is the oldest running project and the one closest to my heart.  I'd like to take down some of my stories that have hit deadends, but in order to keep the idea up, I'm leaving them there until others write some stories.  If any of these projects interest you or if you want to create a new project, just let me know at  urlLink mindevol@hotmail.com
My best wishes are with Carrie and Shari on their journey back to academia.  In accordance with what Ned said, I almost wish sometimes I was taking classes, almost.  By the way Carrie, I always favored merchandise with anything to do with Grover from Sesame Street, but I'm sure you probably have different tastes.
I've not broken a single bone my entire life, except my skull.  1. Age 3:  My brothers dropped an airgun from the roof of a fort on stilts onto my head in which led to me running around the back yard with blood spurting from my head like chicken on Sunday morning.  Stitches on that one. Not sure how many.  2. Age 10 - Rock fight!  Alot of bleeding from the head, but I don't think my skull was in too bad of shape.  3. Age 21 - On a tab, my friends decided to lock me in my room for my own protection, but instead I decided to escape out of my bedroom window, which didn't lead outside directly.  It lead to the basement stairs.  I got out to the basement stairs ok, but the door to go outside from there opened into the stairs and my friends came around to stop me from escape.  Well, the door opened and I went backwards down the stairs on my back and through 5 pane glass windows which were laid against the wall at the bottom of the steps.  I remember lying there looking up at a silhouette at the top of the stairs that said, "Is he dead?"  I'm pretty sure I wasn't.  4. Age 26 - Clay told me the damn rope swing was safe and that they used to swing on it all last summer.  I grabbed the broom stick through the knot on the rope and swung over the very large chasm only to hear "snap".  Next thing I remember was what seemed like an hour long ride down the hill on my back using my head as a battering ram to clear the path.  I climbed back up the hill afterwards with bloody head and face and was offered a fifth of scotch by loving brother Clay, not to tell his wife.  I accepted.  All in all though, I think I'm just fine.
Dave - No, I don't have anything but memories of my grandfather.  I do remember reading through a book called "The Bluebook Project" and reading a testimony by Jimmy Carter about a UFO sighting and looking up to see my Grandfather smile at me.  I thought he was going to take it away from me, but he wasn't concerned.  I was about 7 years old I think.  That's about it though on the UFO thing.
Clay, you ignorant slut -  I didn't mean to trash the reputation of a great man.  I just thought it was kooky and entertaining that when I typed his name into google, I got all this UFO stuff.  I only quoted that article, because that was the only article I found that had something to quote besides his name listed and the photograph.  Personally, I'm not ashamed that he was a founder of the NICAP, but I suppose you and Dad disagree with me.  So there!  THpbbbphhht!  P.S. I've removed the quote, but not the page.
I've never met you, but I'm always learning new words from your blogs.  Happy Birthday Jim Robinson!
Wow, my grandfather was one of the Real Men in Black.  I did a search on google for him and it came up with a bunch of pages on UFO's.  His name is Col. Robert B. Emerson.  He was one of the founders of the NICAP.  I told my Dad, but I think he doesn't want his father to be remembered for that.  I think it's cool.    Here's a  urlLink page.      some other pages I found him on include:   urlLink http://members.evansville.net/slk/state64.htm                                                                 urlLink http://www.li.net/~rjcohen/nicap.html                                                                Here's a picture of him, but they named him Ralph B. Emerson by mistake                                                                   urlLink http://www.nicap.dabsol.co.uk/photo.htm

The attitude that I've always expressed with my clothing has been that "I don't care about my clothing."  This is a skill that I have dedicated much time and effort to masterfully craft.
The picture on the right also spells a word.  The picture on the left is a couple kissing under an arch of grapevine.  It took me forever to see the one on the left.
Well my company's site went live today.  It's still not finished, but the main framework is done.  Still need to add pictures, sounds, and my portfolio, but  urlLink here  it is.
Clay - Happy Birthday tommorrow!  I think you're taking your frustrations about your lake out on that poor innocent man, the Governor.  If I were you, I'd go over to Jim's, get really drunk, and then spout off your opinions to his neighbor in person.  But that's just me I guess.  Jim S. - I think the haze is boredom and the only thought to keep you going is that there must be something better just around the bend.  If there isn't anything naturally occurring around the bend, I'm sure you'll create something wonderful anyway.  Hank - I miss ya.   Heidi - You cheeky bird!  Are we feeling randy?  Are you wishing from all these responses that you didn't even mention the boy crazy thing?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Just two pictures that I like.  You can see two different things in both of them.  The one on the left is a little more difficult to see.
Mon Dieu!  It works.... If I could just get blogger to make my first date the right size, I'd be in business.  Check out the links.  FLASH!  Ahhahhhhhhhhh.... Savior of the universe!
My site here is going to be under construction for a while.  I'm trying out a few things a little at a time.  Maybe in a week or so, I'll have a finished design.
I've been wrapped up in business B.S. for awhile.  Things are starting to pan out into a steady work rhythm now, so I hope I can start posting more regularly.  I love the new designs I'm seeing.   I'm jealous as hell.  As soon as I get a free weekend, I'll have to try to keep up with the Jones'.     urlLink Sonya  - Wow...  I absolutely love your artwork.    I can't get over what a talented bunch of people this group is.  You guys always surprise the hell out of me as I learn more and more about you.  Not much going on here... work, work, work.... I'd like to talk about something else, but that's all there seems to be at the moment.  I know, I'll make another trivial differences of England and the States list.  Some good things about England -   1.  A jar of peanut butter only costs about 60 cents and really tastes like it uses real peanuts.  Soup in a can that says it has meat in it, actually has alot of meat in it.  2.  A great deal of the T.V. announcers here have severe lisps.  (It cracks me up at least once a week.)  3.  After a rain, these giant snails come out everywhere.  These things are huge, and look like something out of a Lewis Carroll story.  Also, I prefer magpies to crows.  Magpie's just seem to have a whole lot of personality.  They look just like crows except they are white with black wings and a black head.  4.  English documentary's are in my opinion the best in the world, and I get to see alot of them here.  5.  I've got hypothyroidism and have to take a pill everyday and go to the doctor's for a blood test once a year.  The visits to the doctor and medication for this is free for me here.   Some bad things about England -  1.  England closes at 11pm.   2.  You have to pay a monthly tax to watch regular airwaves T.V.  Also, I pay an $800 city tax (for fire, police, museums, etc...) on top of all my regular taxes.  (The English sure do know how to tax.)  3.  All the radio stations have the same fucking dance beat 24/7.  With my napster now out of reach, I'm in musical hell.  4.  A bottle of Jack cost about $50 and a pack of cigs cost about $7.  (It's kind of good, I guess, 'cause I've had to quit both.) (wine and beer are the same price as in the States)  5.  Tabloids, tabloids, tabloids!!!  This country is star gossip crazy!  Well, that's good enough for now.  I haven't sat down and actually read through the blogs in awhile.  I'll try to catch up on the most recent ones.  I hope everyone is doing well.  Cheers.
Welcome back  urlLink Becky.
wow, thanks for the  urlLink link  Ned.  The Cave of Time brings back memories.  I think I read all of Edward Packard's Choose Your Own Adventures. I even wrote my own in sixth grade.  I think I got to about page 200 before I quit.  Of course it was complete with my own pencil illustrations.  Wish I could find that.  It must be somewhere in my parents' attic.
urlLink Jim A.  - I like swami.
Yeah.... someday I'm gonna own this pathetic little island.
urlLink Sean  - I like the new look.  I almost feel like changing mine now.  Don't have that kind of energy at the moment though.
Let me set things right about the Chris thing....  Chris Lea is my boss, cousin, friend, money source.  Chris Hill is my friend, Floridian,  Navy guy, Jenwei totin' mutherfu...  I love them both very much.  hope that clears things up.
CHA CHING!!!!  I just sold my first website to an insurance company for over a thousand quid!  That's about $1,400.00 for you Yanks. Yessssssss!  It's not up yet, but I'll link to it once it's in action. Da gears be a rollin', and da money be flowin'.  (I'm doing the cabbage patch dance as I say this)  Hopefully, Chris didn't name this company Greenforge for nothing.  I have our company site up, but I designed it when I first got here so it pretty much sucks.  I'll be revamping it sometime this month so I'll give a link then.
urlLink Sean ,  urlLink Dave ,  urlLink Phil  - I haven't read any sci-fi for a while... ok, I haven't read anything for a while.  I'm taking the entire list you guys came up with to the library this weekend and will pick one of them from my impression of the pretty picture on the cover or maybe something intriguing from the back synopsis.   urlLink Chris Hu.  - First off, to prevent further confusion, I will now refer to Chris Hill as Hank and continue calling you Chris.  Secondly, I think it is entirely cruel to make it impossible to back up from your site.  Oh yeah, and I love the design, although it makes me doubt my worth or even my existence as a designer.  Luckily, I live in England where the standards for a decent site are much lower.   urlLink Sonya  - Sorry about the confusing CBD (Central Business District) reference.  Jim S. says that it is a N'awlins thing, but I could have sworn I've heard that term in other cities.  Anyway, I felt that if I went down to the CBD of any large city and wandered around for a while, my mind would have a picture engrained into my visual cortex very much resembling your painting which would then be stored away in the depths of my cerebellum to be brought out when anyone said a word that even slightly hinted at a CBD.  Now that you have shown me this painting, I've brought my own version back into conscious thought, put it and your painting into my frontal lobe for comparison and analysis, and after a week or so both will be put back into memory as a new thing.  Of course there are emotions attached to these visuallizations and everybody probably feels a little different about this kind of image, but that's the beauty of a picture like that.  Being a suburban boy who eventually moved to the big city, several in fact, it represents the cold, harsh reality of a netless adventure.
urlLink Hank  - I think John and Jen are a myth as well.  I went to his wedding and there was this big guy in a tux who was pretending to be John, but the booze was free so I didn't say anything.

I would really like to know the story about that plane that crashed near Pittsburg.  I can't imagine what heroism went down there, but I'm sure there will be several TV movies in the future to let me know.
There is this school next to me that is a school for troubled kids.  One of them asked for a light when I walked by so I complied.  I hung around for a few minutes to ask them about their institution.  My reasons were not for their benefit, because they have been throwing bottles and standing out in the street stopping cars.  I thought I might get some insight by trying to be friendly and mixing in to see what they were up to.  Lo and behold, I discover that I am concidered an adult.  They all started fidgeting and many walked away.  When did I become an adult?  Oh well, my intentions, like I said weren't for their benefit, so I suppose that scene played out for the best.  I walked away without further questioning.
I've taken an unexpected break away from the blog, not just writing, but reading.  I'll try to check back up on everyone today.   I am reading a very cool book.  I mentioned it before, but I hadn't started reading it at that time.  I didn't even need to read "Life on Mars" by Paul Chambers... what a piece of crap.  Everything that was in that book by a real micropaleontologist was in this new book I'm reading in a few paragraphs.  The new book I'm reading is by a spelunker.  (Excuse my spelling on all this)  He's not even a scientist, but he's really done his research and he actually has worked with many of the crucial scientists involved in all this.  He makes me want to drop everything I'm doing and learn how to explore caves and work for scientists exploring life there.  If anyone is interested in by far the largest group of life on earth and the oldest, one which lives deep beneath the earth's surface without oxygen or sunlight, I highly recommend this book.   "Dark Life" by Michael Ray Taylor.  The prospects of life in our solar system other than on Earth seem very good.  The universe must be full of it.  On another view, he also goes into the life around us.  Your body has ten times the amount of organisms living on you as you have actual human cells.
I've been watching this documentary that's been on T.V. on a weekly basis here called Blue Planet about Deep Sea exploration.  God, it's amazing.  Are they showing this in the States now?  I wish I could post some of the pictures that they are showing, but I can't find them on the net anywhere.   urlLink Here's a link to the documentary site.   I'm kind of bummed with the site because it is geared at kids only, but I did manage to steal a flash cartoonish animation of what I think is called a rat trap fish and put it on the main df page.  They have two red glowing headlights under their eyes and a huge mouth that extends.  I could not believe all the bio-illumination that is in the deep ocean.  I am currently reading two books, one called Life on Mars (just finished it), which I can't recommend too much, but it did explore possible ways that life could exist on Mars and the other book is Dark Life which is about life that exists in deep caves that use chemosynthesis instead of photosynthesis.  Anyway, this Blue Planet documentary went into the ocean ridges that pour out sufides from the Earth's mantle supporting a whole ecosystem at the bottom of lightless ocean.  I knew about that already, but then it went into a whole ecosystem that survives off methane gas at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico.  Never heard of that.  It was complete with an underwater lake.  Yes, that's right, an underwater lake.  It looked so cool.  It's saline content was more heavy than the surrounding water so a lake formed under the clear waters of the deep Gulf.  Cool stuff, I highly recommend checking the documentary out.  They are showing a great number of never before seen species.  Supposedly, man has only explored about 1% of the ocean floor.
I don't feel that religion for the most part has a negative influence on World Peace.  I think many wars have been waged in the name of religion throughout man's history, but that religion was not actually the cause.  I feel that more likely it has been used as a tool by rulers of nations to unite it's masses and gain whatever they felt like gaining from other nations. Mainly I blame sheer ignorance, which with the resources of this modern age is hopefully becoming less of a factor.  All major religions teach peace, tolerance, and love.  I think the world of today is much more aware of the difference between the majority of people who adhere to their religious doctrines and the minority who alter the purpose of these doctrines by picking through details that do not reflect the larger message.  I hope so, anyway.
Maybe this is insane, but I have the need to hear Beach Boys music.  Call me crazy.     urlLink I get around    urlLink Good Vibrations
My friend Stinger sent me this PBS  urlLink link .  It's a good overall look at Osama bin Laden and his views towards the West.  The interviews might be a refreshing source of information for those that are tired of speculation about the man.
I'm very relieved to know that we will not be at war with Pakistan.   urlLink Sources: Pakistan OKs U.S. Demands
Is this all part of Osama bin Laden's plan?   urlLink Here's one Afghan-American's point of view.
Hank?  I know that's pointless to ask, because he is a Navy man, but .... hank?
I must say that my thoughts are with President Bush in traveling around the country to various venues.  Even with all the extra security, I think I would be pretty damn scared to be making so many public appearances.  At the same time, he seems to be maintaining his composure.  Cheers, George.  I hope that you are holding yourself together.
Last night I went out with Cousin Chris to see a movie that I would have never gone to see normally (Rush Hour 2).  I can't say that it was a spectacular movie or anything, but I have to admit that the lightness of this movie is exactly what I needed.  Before the movie I ate an entire plate of the hottest Chicken Vindaloo I have every eaten in my entire life.  Tears were flowing out of eyes, sweat poured from my forehead, I used up my alloted amount of napkins quickly to contol my nose leakage, and the room shifted back and forth like in the peak of an acid trip, but I would not stop eating until it was gone.  Anyway, if Chris is reading this, even though I looked and acted like a zombie from hell during the meal and before the movie, I am glad that we decided to go out and do something.
What I see here in England is amazing support for America.  One big concern though, is that they feel the Prime Minister has given Bush a blank check to do what he wants without question from this country.  Alot of focus has been brought to attention about how this needs to be a worldwide effort.  Powell's comment today, "We will not be constrained by the fact that we are working with others as well", was somewhat understandable from my point of view as an American, but I believe it is very unnerving for most in Europe. Another issue that I am sure is on the minds of those around me, but which I haven't heard a thing of from the newspapers, or on T.V., is racial relations in North England.  The Pakistani's have been treated like second class citizens here, (e.g.  There is a 5% unemployment rate overall and a 30% Muslim unemployment rate, and it is not that Muslims do not want to work), and as a result I'm sure most of you have heard of all the racial riots that have been taking place in the last few months.  No riots or racially motivated crimes have hit the news since the big event on Tuesday and I hope this calm lasts as long as possible.   So many issues are connected to the upcoming events that I certainly feel unqualified to make predictions, make statements of belief, or even ask questions to the public at large that would fuel opinions based purely on emotion or contruibute to the chaos of misinformation.  I hope this group understands that I live alone in a foreign country and it is only my comfort with this group that I have the nerve to express my ideas so openly and so untested.  Most of me feels that I should shut up and just wait and watch, but that other part of me can't help poking and prodding in a search to define what is happening.  I'm very thankful to have this forum to express myself and I'm very thankful that I get to read such thought provoking insights from the Drunkenfish and the Tanque.
I was quick to anger; couldn't help it.  I understand that most of you may disagree with what I said yesterday, but I stand by it for the most part.  The World War III stuff might have been pushing my envelop for prediction.  Of course we need to gather information and proceed with knowledge and forethought.  All of NATO should act on this together as a checks and balance system, to make sure we are pursuing a just course of action.  Countries like Afghanastan and Pakistan who use their government and intellegence agencies to train terrorists must be stopped though.  We cannot sit back and let this type of organized terrorism keep growing.  We have been warned for years by the countries that are consistantly victimized by this, but understandably we could not comprehend the true urgency of their pleas.  I am and will always be a pacifist and a supporter of human rights.  Every measure should be taken to preserve these ideals, but I believe we have a responsibility to ourselves and the world to lead the way in ending these intolerable organizations of zealot murderers.  I hope that we can use a surgical approach to this, but somehow we have to get the job done.  Perhaps the best way to achieve this would be with the aid of those countries accused of harboring terrorists and even with those that are supporting and training these types of organizations.  Ideally, those nations involved in these activities would work side by side with us to correct the situation.  However, I don't believe that it will be  that  easy.
This whole thing sank in last night and this morning for me.  My initial reaction was that bombing was entirely the wrong way to go, because it would just be killing innocent people and escalating American hatred throughout the middleeast.  I didn't even comprehend going all the way with this to World War III.  Now that I look at the options and the gravity of what has happened, I think we should prepare for war against all the nations that harbor our enemy.  I'm absolutely stunned at what is happening here.  This kind of terrorism absolutely cannot be allowed to happen.  I believe as the only superpower that we have the ability to save ourselves and that the survival of our way of life is worth preserving.  I believe we, the U.S., will have many allies in this war.  We will not be alone.  This isn't an angered child striking back from frustration.  It's an entire civilization, incorporating most of the world's population, who will not allow our nations to be subjected to living in a constant state of fear.
Is it going to be Iraq, Afghanistan, or Pakistan?  I fear and loath that one of these places will be hit soon.  I would much rather organized assasinations, rather than the usual response of bombing.  Bombing is going to just result in the deaths of innocent people and multiply American hatred around the world.
wow...
Sean - Was that a dream?  The virtual world people  are  real, aren't they?
Welcome back  urlLink Jason !  I started him out about a year ago, but things got sidetracked and I was a cruel dictator of the drunkenfish back then.  I deleted everyone who hadn't posted in the last week or so.  In any case, things are a bit more loose now, so have fun my friend.
I'm a little drunk, but maybe this is a valid question.  Is the inner region of our galaxy older than than the outer?  I just read the  urlLink nytimes article  about the black hole in the center of the Milky Way.  I can't find anything on that subject.  I'm thinking about whether the solar system was created by the friction of  this black hole or if it was created before hand and then pulled in.  A huge gap possibly in my astronomy knowledge, but maybe someone can clue me in.  My thinking is that most solar systems had to result from the friction of this thing in the center of our galaxy.  The black hole originating from a bunch of gas particles that just happen to be near each other to start the gravitation thing happening would seem to be rare enough of an event that the rest of all of this would have had to have been created by this original phenomenon.  Yes JimS., there's that word again that clues you that I'm drunk.  Actually, I'll say this theory, since all know I'm drunk, that dark matter is everywhere and that there are areas that gravitation pulls together large concentrations of this which forms mass and pulls things by the nature of the process of gravitation into it and what we see are the byproducts.  (particles, light waves)  These things are just reflections of the dark matter gathering together producing these energy responses.  I'll shut up now, because I don't know what the hell I'm saying.
I found an article on the web by my fantasy wife, Deirdra Funcheon.  That's who I lived with in Florida with John and Jen.  She's dreamy.   urlLink http://www.nypress.com/13/47/news&columns/feature.cfm
Ned again - I'm going to try to convince Chris Lea to start Geocaching with me.  With winter coming up though, it might not happen until spring.  It might be worth it to go ahead and do it in the cold.  Who knows?  By the way, I'm a vid-game junkie myself, looking for a fix.  My ADSL connection is pretty good, although each leap to get to where you are might make things hairy.  Don't know, but I'm willing to try.  I'll go out and purchase Unreal Tournament soon.  I have Unreal, but I'm assuming the Tournament is a separate thing.  Another game that I have and find extremely fun to multiplay is BattleZone 2, if anyone is interested.  I used to play Jimmy in the arcade play, but for some reason could never convince him to play me in my favorite part of the game which is the strategic game.  He's probably just scared of my superior intellect.
Ned - I've never had a job long enough for it to define me.  I'm not a good enough artist of any kind for that to define me either.  When people ask me what I do, I generally either joke and say, "you mean today?" or  "I watch T.V. generally," or I just say whatever my current job is as if I have had a career at it.  It has become a big problem really.  I've not built any skills.  You may think your job is easy, but that's because you are surrounded by it everyday.  Whether you feel you are an expert or not, you are.  You've started a career, built on it, and now it seems like cake.  You're paid for your knowledge, not your difficulties in performing the job.  God, I'd be a millionaire if I could just be paid for the stress I create for myself.  I honestly cannot think of a single profession that I would be comfortable doing for the rest of my life.  Most people probably don't.  The difference between me and most people though is that they are willing to stick with something long enough to make that thing comfortable.   I think the key to this whole career thing is to pick something and stay with it for at least 10-15 years.  After that you should be able to make safe financial moves towards things of interest instead of necessity.  I'm not saying that there aren't those special people that love what they do, but to me that fits into the same catagory as finding that one person that is made for you.  Either you are lucky enough to trip over that or you're not.  I don't think either is something you can search for.  Anyway, I'm starting to think on both of those issues that you should grab the best thing you can find and then work at staying with it.  (Did I just do a plug for monogamy? ... and in that sense am I suggesting that you should give a relationship 10-15 years until you can make a safe emotional move towards something of interest instead of necessity...  hurm...)
Good eye JimS.  Yeah, I was drunk.  Maybe I shouldn't have even mentioned that subject yesterday.  I don't usually like deleting things, but I'm doing it this time.
Well, this is my last post on this computer.  I'm packing it up tommorrow to sell before I leave.  What will I do without a computer!!!  No worries, though..  Jim has plenty and it will definitely be a priority of mine, once I'm back on my financial feet to purchase another.  My blogging has slipped back into boring short dribble lately.  Some may say. "lately?"  I say, "suck my..."  no I don't, I just shrug my shoulders and don't say anything.  Sort of how I blog.  I remember surfing the net and providing links and speaking occasionally about life and embarassing the hell out of myself with drunken posts... What's happened to me?  I've turned into a PC (two meanings on the PC) zombie.  I really am embarrassed for myself.  I haven't been creating any art in the last three years either.  I sure wish my brain would come back.  It's not like I'm doing anything more important, so where the hell is my brain?  My creativity is gone.  I can't even pick up a fiction book... I used to love 'em.  I stare at the cover and decide it would be a waste of my time.  Like I said before, "I'm not doing anything important!"  I'm hoping that seeing old friends might pull me out of this funk, but I know it all comes down to a decision from me to save me.  I'm not apologizing for my blogs, I'm just saying that I too, recognize how fucking boring they are.  I'm not going to worry about it too much though.  Everyone blogs in a different way and just as darkness helps us appreciate the light, boring helps us appreciate the facinating.   Here's my  urlLink favorite commercial  in England to make up for the lack of entertainment in this last forced blog from this place.  After you enter the site, visit  Great Britain  and  play the Dream Club Ad .  They might show it in the States also, but if so, it's always worth a second watch.
urlLink Chistopher  - "Love Shack, baby Love Shack!!"  (Sorry, it's the psychotic, axe-wielding, circus clown in my head that made me do that.)
I'll be leaving England on the 4th of November and landing in New York around noonish... I want to visit the WTC for awhile and then I'll take a bus from there to Indy.  Thankyou Jim S. for all your support for me in this move.
Well, I don't think register.com was that fast at locating the new server from this site, but I have moved it none the less.  It's up for now, but it will switch to our new server soon.  Bluemarble just isn't reliable anymore so we've been temporarily moved to the Greenforge server in Liverpool.  As soon as Jimmy's server is up, (and I haven't even asked Jimmy, but I'm assuming) we'll switch over to his server and then we will have more control over our stability.  Sort of the same reason I'm moving back to the States in light of my financial situation.  Anyway, I think all around I'm making the right choices.  LONG LIVE THE DRUNKENFISH!!!!
Whew, what a hangover.  Did you say something John?  Love?  Of course brother, unconditionally.  That's always a given.
Well, it's official.  I'm leaving England.  We gave it a good shot and the company is still going to be in place, but it's going dormat for awhile.  I don't think I will be involved in it's revival when that time comes, but who knows.   I don't have any details yet, but I believe I will be landing in Indianapolis in late November or early December and then driving with JimS. down to West Palm Beach, Florida, where I'm planning to live.  As far as a job?   Damn, got me there.  My guess is that I'll probably deliver pizza for a month or so until I find a computer tech job.  I'll probably try to put web sites together from here out on a per project basis for extra cash.  Moving is always such a bitch.  From the moment I decide to move to the moment I'm sitting alone on my new home's floor with a beer in my hand, I'm never quite myself.  I just go into transfer mode with all my thoughts bent on scanning my memories and analyzing posibilites.  I remember Sting said something very simple in an interview once that always has stuck with me.  (I'm paraphrasing here)  "I think the greatest beauty in life is not knowing what is around the corner."
Todo Hardbottle here.  Is that a Heidi I see stirring about in the drunkenbattleblog?  Cool.  I haven't been there for awhile as a legit drunk, because I guess I've gained some respect for myself.  NOT!  I've just been too drunk to type.  Sorry to hear about the eye trouble Di.  Those only occur to me when I have dates.  Phil - Let it out brother!  I identify with your current situation.  Hope things turn up on the flip side.  They usually do.  Liz - I agree that there is a certain stress level created by all these terrible events..  Not to give terrorism it's prime objective, but it really does do what it is meant to do.  Hopefully, this blogging community helps us realize that that stress is real, it can affect our daily lives, and that we can overcome it.  (Don't mean to sound like Dr. BuddaBen)  Ned - Two negative numbers multiplied together produce a positive number because Jesus wants it that way.
Welcome back dumbass!  *sniffle, sniffle*  I feel like the whole family is back together again.
Welcome back Sonya, you were missed.  I hope you and Sean enjoy your new location amongst good friends.
When I arrived here, I was presented with a common English dish, Beans and Toast.  To me, two starches just do not go together in one dish.  Over the year that I've been here though, I've noticed that when I'm low on groceries, the two things left in the cupboard are, you guessed it, bread and beans.  When in Rome, I suppose.
I may be way over simplifying this, but it sure would be nice if a respected Islamic figure would stand up and denounce Osama bin Laden as not representing the Islamic faith.  I think that would do alot for allowing muslims around the world to realize that this isn't a fight of the west against Islam.
I'm just the kind of dude to ruin a good thing by over doing it, but here's another test.  This one's short and stupid, but I love Selma so I had to share.  The Simpson's character I'm most like is:  Selma Bouvier   urlLink

Thanks for thinking of me Liz!  I wouldn't want anyone to go through that much trouble for me though.  I'll just have to concentrate on learning how to use the spray.
Osama bin Laden has financed the Taliban and is so close to them that he has even married off one of his own daughters to the leader of the Taliban, Mullah Muhammad Omar. The Taliban have provided refuge for bin Laden since 1994 while terrorist camps producing holy warriors on a holy war against the U.S. have been steadily growing in production.  I'm convinced that we need to do something about this.  I hope that more permanent lines of aid can be provided for the Afghan people after we gain further control of the area.  The people of Afghanistan certainly have my sympathy for the suffering they have been going through for such a long time, but Bush would go down as the idiot of the millinium if he didn't do anything about terrorism, given this opportunity of more world support than we have ever had on the issue.  I support the U.S. efforts to destroy terrorist strongholds and believe we must send a clear warning to those that support these networks.  I suppose that I will have problems with various steps along the way, but I feel it would be naive to suggest that we should only negotiate without action.
I'm sorry for being so trivial in such serious times, but are those stitches on Bush's head?  I cannot even approach the events that are happening this evening... I just have to wait and watch.  I think and hope that we are doing the right thing.
I can't find stick deodorant anywhere in England and have been forced to learn the complicated task of using spray.  I just failed my first lesson by not noticing the spray nozzle was pointed in the wrong direction.  Nothing like a quick burst of butane to the eye to make a person feel stupid.  I hope this twitch won't be permanent.  I've been trying to use roll-on, but I've lost most of my underarm hair by very painfully removing them one hair per morning.  Can't I just take a pill to hide my smell?  Why did I just tell everyone that?  I also, blame the coffee.
Welcome  urlLink Di-Havanna ... I hope she finds this forum is what she needs to post her thoughts.  By the way, Diana, there is no such thing as a private conversation here.
Sonya - I know exactly what you mean when you say that you appreciate him not making you feel guilty.  There are homeless all over the place here and some who sell what is called "The Big Issue".  I'm assuming it's England's version of "Streetwise", but I've never seen Streetwise.  I went through various modes of thought through the years on my approach to beggars.  I used to to think as I walked through inner city Atlanta to go to school or work, that there is no way I can give out change everyday to all these people with their hands out.  There's just way too many of them.  At that point, I just made it a general rule to ignore them at all times.  I know life must be hard for them to be out there doing that... I never have taken the notion that they were getting a free ride off of society.   Anyway, later in life, I realized that my policy to protect the change in my pockets had become fairly rigid.  Why not hand out change when I can?  The only steadfast rules I follow now on panhandlers is 1. I don't give people change unless I am alone.  2. I don't give change to those who follow me or are anything but humble in their position.  I have various reasons for both of those rules and following them allows me to hand over a couple of quid a week and have a few very, very brief pleasant conversations.
Redesign coming soon.  Hopefully that will encourage me to start posting again.  Happy Foodtalknap Day!  I'm headed over to James' sister's house for Thanksgiving dinner in about an hour.  Can't wait to make a complete pig out of myself.  I won't know everyone there so to avoid awkwardness in conversation, I'll just say when asked any questions, "Hey!  Can't you see I'm eatin' here!"  and then turn my head down and rejoin the pig session.  Hope everyone enjoys the holidays.

urlLink Clay  - I just wanted to mention outloud to everyone that your last post about Aubrey's page being a memorial was completely misunderstood by me and probably everyone else.  I thought you were saying that because she hasn't posted that her page was a lonely memorial, but I never noticed what you were actually pointing out.    urlLink And that was the time and date of the post.   Don't know why I didn't catch that, because I was signing her up when I received a phone call from Chris Lea saying that two of the WTC had been hit by planes.
Phil - eh... so I was wrong.  Never met a violet before.  I got the spirituality right...  indigo in color is not that far from violet...and uh... hey, I was drunk when I made the assessment.
Well, it's been years since I looked at my aura book.  Mainly because I finally realized I was riding some big ego trip that the book creates from the Indigo color, but I really like the book and if all can take it with a grain of salt then it's a blast.  Just because I'm stoned and really feel like typing I'll write out Blue as an example for Carrie.  This gets very lengthy so be warned.  (if anyone else wants the description for their aura color then I'll try to scan the pages or something and e-mail the info.)  BLUE -   Blues embody the characteristics of nurturing and care-taking.  They are the Personality Spectrums color most concerned with helping other people.  Whereas Nurturing Tans find their life's work in the community, Blues find value in being of service to individuals.  Service is a form of altruism, a giving of oneself.  It is the art of anticipating the needs of other human beings and ministering to those needs while at the same time allowing the individuals to maintain their dignity.  In doing a dindness for a neighbor or performing an act of mercy for a patient, Blues feel fulfilled, valued, and of worth; they find ways to live their lives by giving. The greatest challenge for Blues is to know what they need to be happy and then to ask for it.  Because they are so caught up in service to others, Blues often spend too little time and attention on their own spiritual and emotional growth activities.  They must set limits and boundaries on their emotional, physical, and spiritual resources; they must be able to say no and mean it.  Blues need to emulate the wise cook who returns a portion of the starter dough to the yeast pot for another day.  In this way, Blues can maintain their personal power.  They must learn how to husband their own internal resources by measuring thenm out and using some of their time and energy to renew themselves.  BLUEs Approach to Physical Reality  Blues do not find much to recommend physical reality.  To them it is dirty, harsh, and ugly.  Even an idyllic country scene viewed from a hilltop is, on close inspection, found to be alive with thousands of creepy, crawling bugs.  Blues tend to live in the realm of emotions and feelings, which are more real to them than the external environment. Left to their own devices, Blues do not particularly care for strenuous, sweaty physical activity or exercise.  It makes them hot and sticky, a most unpleasant experience.  However, they do enjoy sports that have a component of camaraderie, such as softball, volleyball, and bowling, or a component of grace and beauty, such as dancing, swimming, and horseback riding.  They enjoy walking as a way of experiencing nature or being with friends out-of-doors.  Exercise classes that incorporate gentle stretching, with a less hectic atmosphere than aerobics, appeal to Blues.  Endurance sports requiring constant physical conditioning generally do not attract Blues, because they perceive that amount of attention to oneself as indulgent and narcissistic. Blues tend  to have an endomorphic body type - the "earth mother" figure.  Tehy put on weight easily, especially after the birth of children.  In an era with so much emphasis on diet, exercise, slender figures, and no hips, Blues are at a disadvantage.  Full-figured, especially after menopause, Blues need to understand that their beauty lies in their ability to nurture and support others and in their pleasing personalities.  BLUEs Mental Attitudes  The Blues' greatest gift is their highly develooped intuition.  They are extremely sensitive to the emotional vibrations of others.  However, it is extremely difficult for them to translate what they know intuitively into useful information.  In the decision-making process, emotions, feelings, and hunches are not usually given equal weight with the facts and figures.  Therefore, Blues feel less adequate than other colors when it comes to making an intellectual contribution.  The ability to collect, sort, and retrieve information is an acquired skill, one that Blues must learn, specifically through training in critical thinking. Like all the Emotional/Spiritual Colors, Blues are holistic thinkers.  They grasp all the parts of a disscussion or decision-making model simultaneously, juggling outcomes and the attendant consequences, assessing and evaluating cause and effect, always holding open the alternative options. If a Green thinks in a binary manner, cutting and paring options at every choice point on the binary tree, a Blue mentally hangs on to the whole tree, never letting go of any of the potential options.  since Blues hold all the alternative solutions simultaneously in mind, it is no wonder they have a difficult time making decisions!  Blues can get bogged down in the details and feel unsure of where they are going or how to proceed.  The most important skill a Blue can learn is how to focus, to cut away all issues and concerns that do not have immediate pertinence to the problem at hand. In school, Blues do well in subjects that place a high degree of emphasis on intuition or feelings:  literature, creative writing, art, and drama.  Those subjects requiring a linear approach, like mathematics or the hard sciences, teach the skills of memorization, organization, and building hierarchies.  These are the subjects that assist Blues in learning to handle real-world data.  It is frustrating for Blues to know the answer to a math problem and not know how they got it. Although they are highly emotional, Blues can do well in businessk, especially those having a service component that allows Blues to work closely with other people.  Blues are capable of making decisions; they are just slower and more deliberate than other colors.  They lack the organizational ability of the Mental Tan or the Green, and the strong  personal ego of a Violet. Blues need to create schedules for coping with business situations, schedules that allow them sufficient time to work at their own speed.  Blues need three to seven days to make a big decision.  Given that time, space, and quiet, Blues make good decisions that are well thought out and to which they are committed.  To be comfortable emotionally, they need to ask that all proposals and complaints be put in writing.  This gives them an opportunity to separate the feelings from the action and to create a solution that they can support. Blues weigh all of the factors that must be taken into consideration in any decision-making process:  previous commitments, needs of family and self, the merits of the project, and the intended outcome.  When confronted with employers and customers who demand instant decisions, Blues must be honest about their motives and requirements before they take any action.  Blues take business setbacks personally.  In the world of the Mental Family colors, everything is first an idea; in the world of the Blues, everything is first an emotion.  Acknowledging their feelings and being willing to keep moving in spite of them allows Blues to function successfully in the world of business. The greatest asset a Blue has is emotional commitment.  This is part of the Blues' mental emotional process -  they see the ptential inherent in good ideas, and they want to help others achieve their goals.  Any idea, project, or individual to whom a Blue is bound is indeed fortunate.  A committed Blue is reliable, dependable, and trustworthy.  BLUEs Emotional Makeup  Blue is the color of female energy and uniquly reflects one aspect of feminine energy - the ability to get in touch with and express one's feelings.  Blues make sense of the world through their emotions rather than through physical sensations, as Yellows and Physical Tans do.  Love, hate, hope, despair - these are everday facts of life for Blues.  Emotions are the data base on which they make decisions and take actions. This ability to act from an emotional center is the Blues' greatest asset, but it can also be their greatest liability.  They want to love and care for others and are perceived as loving, thoughtful, kind, and helpful.  The liability comes when emotional confusion clouds the facts of a situation, preventing the Blues from making the best decisions.  They are unable to discern, for example, the difference between being taken advantage of and being asked to give a little extra effort to achieve success. Because they are so sensitive and pick up nonverbal cues to the moods of others, Blues are not acknowledged for what they know.  Mates and employers, who use a more rational approach, ask what data the Blues have to support their opinion.  Since the data are usually feelings, they are discounted as irrelevant, unspecific, or unscientific.  In our society, the intuitive knowledge of a Blue is sometimes disconcerting and may seem irrelevant to those with a more mental outlook.  However, in those areas of life where their specific gift is necessary, where nurturing and caretaking are essential to the continued well-being of the family and community, Blues are perceived as necessary and valuable.  Blues love people.  To serve others is their life's work.  A Blue's sense of well-being comes from tending to the needs of significant others.  This caretaking can take the form of cooking, cleaningk, and throwing parties, or of listening, accompanying a friend to the doctor, and giving advice.  One of the hazardsfor a Blue is being taken for granted by family and others, Blues open themselves to being used, failing to ask for repayment in kind.  Blues assume that others are as sensitive as they are.  The truth is that others don't see the Blues' needs and even if they do, they will let the Blues bear the burden.  This leaves Blues feeling unappreciated for the effort they have made. To combat this, Blues need to be much more assertive.  They need to learn to set limits on their service, to communicate their expectations clearly (including monetary considerations), and to take action if their requests for gratification are not honored.  In short, they must learn assertive communication skills.  The more they allow themselves to be victimized, the more sorry they feel for themselves, which leads to a resort to a whole cycle of complaint, which sometimes leads to real and imagined illnesses, the most serious of which is the loss of self-esteem and respect. Blues must learn that their needs are as important as the wants and needs of others.  They must learn to nurture themselves, to give to themselves as generously as they give to others. Blues need to nurture the emotional side of their personality.  Activities that support this include keeping a journal, writing, reading, listening to music, enjoying quiet times alone or outdoors, being with friends, and being listened to.  Without an opportunity to sort out their jumble of feelings, Blues find themselves in an endless morass of emotions without resolution. Blues express their emotions through the language of laughter and tears, both of which bubble to the surface easily and quickly, much to the Blues' embarrassment.  This is not an affectation, but rather the spontneous release of pent-up emotion that, if kept inside, would cause physical problems like headaches. Blues know intuitively that language is a poor medium ofexpression for the rich depth and texture of what goes on inside them.  They are touched deeply by sunsets, church music, and being with a loved one.  When they and their partner have mated at the spiritual level, Blues are so overcome with the emotion of that experience that they express their joy and happiness in tears. Blues also cry when they are angry.  Contrary to popular opinion, Blues do not use tears as a manipulative device for getting their own way.  When confronted with an agnry spouse or employer, they should first express the emotion represented by the tears. - anger, rage, frustration, helplessness, or betrayal.  Only then can they move into a more rational discussion of the situation and search for alternative resolutions. Blues understand that htere is an underlying logic to what they are feeling.  They cannot explain it; they can only feel the emotions.  For them to ignore or disparage this aspect of themselves is to abdicate the source of their power.  When in touch with their feelings, Blues are galvanized into action.  For Blues, emotions are the coin of human interaticon, without which there is nothing worthwhile.  well, that enough I suppose... I love the book, but it's like the beatles for me now... already heard it a million times.   The actual book is so much cooler than that web page I found.  "What Color Is Your Aura"  by Barbara Bowers, if anyone is interested... anyway, my trip down aura memory lane is done now.
urlLink Phil  - The book I was talking about is "What color is your aura?"  by Barbara Bowers.  There have been many books since that original book using her system  If you really want to dive into the cult that has been created about Indigo's specifically then look up books like "The Indigo Children".   Basically I saw you as Indigo because of your reserved nature, deep spiritual sense, non-conformity, willing to take a non-prestigious career,  direct honesty, etc..   there is alot of stuff about the Indigo that just seemed you.  I've only met two in my life besides myself, so somewhat because you seemed like the other one I met, I threw you in that catagory.    urlLink Here's a brief test I just found for anyone to take.   I'm pretty sure this lady's system is based on Barbara Bowers.  This lady calls some of the auras by different names like nurturing tan is sensitive tan, mental tan is logical tan, etc... Some other auras that I would guess or already know from taking the real book test are:  (some of these are pretty far reaches)  JimS. - Green JimA. - Blue Phil - Indigo John - Lavender Ned - Crystal Heidi - Yellow Dave - Green ChrisH. - Mental Tan Sonya - Magenta Sean - Crystal Shari - Green Clint - Nurturing Tan Becky - Red Hank - Crystal Liz - Magenta? Amos - Mental Tan?  I was going to try to guess everyone, but some people are just too difficult to catagorize.  (Not that anyone wants to be catagorized, but this is all in fun.)
Thank you Sean and Sonya for a cool party.  I was making alot of noise in your basement for how late it was when I finally left.  Hope the neighbors weren't bothered by it.  I woke up extremely disoriented at Ned's with a little help from a wake n' bake n'nap and took a b-line from the couch to the truck without telling anyone good-bye.  It took me about 20 miles of the road before I was actually awake and thinking straight.  It was nice to finally put real people to the blogs.  Thanks to Shari's page I had seen a glimpse of all those people, but meeting them in real life was very enjoyable.  I remember drunkenly telling Phil he was an Indigo.  (just a silly aura book I've had for about 10 or so years that I've showed Ned.  No explanation to Phil at all, just said "Duh, hey you're an Indigo!"  He must have thought I was an idiot.  Anyway, I had tons of fun and hope I get to meet more of the Tanque someday.  Shari got me thinking strongly about going back to school.  My current money situation has to be my priority until I'm financially stable again, but I'm getting dreams of going back to school and getting a masters in Remote Sensing/GIS.  My undergrad degree is in GIS.  I might as well start looking into grants and scholarships and such to see what colleges offer what.  IU would be a great college town to live, but I should probably look around at other schools as well.
well, it's 3:30 and we're still not off yet.  Jim went to drop his dog off at his sister's and hasn't come back yet.  Hang over still hasn't kicked in yet... I'm putting this miracle up there with me getting my college degree.  What a cool world.
Well, I blew it.  I was very, very, drunk last night.  I'm still not hung over this morning.  I'm still in that morning, still drunk, shock phase.  Terrible, awful... I know the trip down to Bloomington will turn into hell along the way.  Sorry bloggers, you're going to get Zombie Ben instead of Ben.  Jimmy quit drinking an hour before we passed out, but I have a feeling he's not much better.  Just know I'm there somewhere in spirit... I'm sure once the alcohol starts flowing that I'll perk up a bit.  It's 2pm and we're about an hour from heading off.  See y'all soon.
Within the same week of me deleting  urlLink Hank 's (Chris Hill (for Di)) link because I think he has given up, he goes and writes a huge ass post.  Like I said before... I'll be fixin' up the links this next week sometime.  He's still linked on the main df page.
The links on this page will be corrected whenever I get enough energy to get off my ass, go through my suitcases to find the Flash software, search the net for cheat codes, install the damn thing, then make my corrections.  I think that could happen within a week.
Welcome  urlLink Todd !  I absolutely adored Athens when I went to school there, and even when I didn't go to school at all.  It's a fun town.   I had almost turned into a Townie by the time I left.
In a slight correction of what Jimmy said about my philosophy on time, I don't think that it's a loop.  Time is just eternal... always has been, always will.  And even if it is not, my point in Jim and I's discussion was that I don't feel it is necessary to create a creator to explain the beginning when we can't explain the creation of a creator.  A view I have expressed since about 12 yrs. old and still feel is pretty valid.  If there was a beginning, then we will just have to wait and be patient in hopes that science will eventually open up our perspective on creation.  Until then, my closest feeling of resolution on the matter is that there is no beginning and no end.  I bought a bed yesterday, a fold out twin.  $25.  What a bargain.  My goals are slowly changing, and I'm feeling like Indy is the place where I need to dig in for now.  I was thinking that I was going to get a quick contract job and then move on to West Palm Beach, but just buying food and paying my student loan and trying to come up with the money to pay for a car/insurance/tags...etc...  Anyway, my goal now is to just try to work contract jobs until I get a permanent one here, get my car, get a 6 month lease on an apartment and work from there to save enough money to move to West Palm Beach safely and securely.  I'm really looking forward to seeing as many of the tanque as possible at Sonya and Sean's on Saturday.  I can't wait.  Tonight I'm headed out to the bars with my bro Clay and two unknown (to me) women for whom my brother said that I need to come along so that he can verify to his wife that nothing happened.  hmmm...  we'll see about that.  I forgot who Clay said they were, but I think it was an ex-co-worker and her sister or something that's in town. I don't plan on getting too crazy, because the thought of showing up to meet the tanquers in a zombie like hang-over from hell, just doesn't seem like a very friendly thing to do.
Made it... that was the worst long ass plane and bus ride of my life.  It's good to finally have arrived, got drunk, and passed out.  I already have a contract job here..  First day! Yeah!!!    I took the religion thingy test... here were my top results. 1.  Theravada Buddhism (100%)    2.  Unitarian Universalism (97%)     3.  Secular Humanism (88%)    4.  Atheists and Agnostics (84%)    5.  Liberal Quakers (82%)    6.  Neo-Pagan (72%)  Post more later... much to do.
Shari - I'm sorry we couldn't make the party.  I would have loved to have been there.  I just saw and heard about it too late.   Happy New Year!

For anyone who saw my earlier post about the condo, I'm just going to cancel the reservation because I couldn't get anyone interested with such short notice.  I did already get Saturday off from work though, so hopefully I'll be able to party it up in Indy.
John - By the way, I never did any redesigns on the main page.  Jim accidently deleted the old drunkenfish and I didn't have a back-up (I'm an idiot), so Jim threw that up so there would at least be something there.
urlLink Phil  - No offense but, I don't think knowing who owns the elvish rings is going to destroy the story for anyone other than hardcore fans... and they already know.  But in your defense, the beginning of the movie spells the story of the rings out, but somehow left out the part about who now owns the elvish rings so.... cheers Peter Jackson... and sorry to all if I overstepped my info on that.
Ahhhhhhh....   I finally got my Lord of the Ring fix.  I thought it was great.  I'm wondering if others will be disturbed because it ends in mid-story.  hmmmmm.... a whole year until the next one.  I actually was standing in line to buy two tickets for me and my brother Matt for the eight o'clock showing at 11:30.  I said, "Two tickets for Lord of the Rings at 8pm please.... and uh... um... one for the 12:00 one.   So I couldn't help myself so what... so I am going to see it twice on the opening day.... so what.... I couldn't help myself.
Some paraphrasing on the rings of power -  At the beginning of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy Sauron possessed the 9 rings of men (worn by the Kings and Princes who became the doomed and enslaved Ringwraiths that could never be released from their ghostly lives) and 3 of 7 dwarvish rings (4 of the dwarvish rings had already been consumed by dragons with their owners).   The rings were created by Celebrimbor with the aid of Sauron.   Sauron deceived the master elven craftsman Celebrimbor by enchanting his evil spells into the rings.  His purpose was to have these rings of power distributed among the greatest of men and dwarves while he secretly forged the one ring to rule them all by his own hand.  Celebrimbor also created 3 elvish rings which Sauron never touched or saw.   These rings were, The ring of Airs (Vilya) mightiest of the three, which bore a great blue stone originally possessed by Gil-galad, who gave the ring to Elrond at the end of the second age; The ring of Waters (Nenya) with a single hard white stone of great beauty, which was always in the keeping of the Lady Galadriel; and the ring of Fire, borne by Cirdan the Shipwright until the end of the first millennium of the Third Age, when he surrendered the Ring with its great red stone to the wizard Gandalf the Grey.   Sauron's one ring was taken from him by force from Sauron's own hand at the end of the Second Age by Isildur son of Elendil.  The ring fiercely burned Isildur when he first seized it and abandoned him in his moment of need during an ambush at Gladden Fields, plunging into   the bottom of a river bed for two thousand years in wait for it's master Sauron to slowly awaken into strength once more.  In the 25th century of the Third age, the ring was stirring because of the growth of power emanating from the Dol Guldur (where it was thought that the leader of the Ringwraiths resided and Greenwood forest was renamed Mirkwood; No one knew that it was actually Sauron himself who resided in that fortress).  A simple hobbit fisherman named Deagol found the One Ring and was instantly murdered by his hobbit friend Smeagol (later known as Gollum) who took the ring and hid deep beneath the Misty Mountains with it.  The Ring, realizing that Gollum was not fullfilling its purpose hidden deep in the mountains after 500 years, ensnared a passing hobbit traveller named Bilbo Baggins who later passed it on to his nephew in 3001 of the Third age. With Sauron grown powerful in the land of Mordor and he being in constant search for this Ring, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy begins.
Don't mind me, I'm just mucking about in my own muck.  Well, I thought that maybe it was selfish to keep the drunkenfish thing going when I don't blog or keep up the site, but now I'm thinking it would be selfish of me to get rid of it.  It's going to be ugly for a while because I don't have a pc, but I'll see what I can do everytime I visit JimS.    If any of the DFies get motivated and want to design or add anything to a new look, go for it.  I just got a full time job yesterday as a vet tech.  Very low pay, but I absolutely love the work.  Getting over my cat allergies might prove difficult, but we'll see.  Wow.... tomorrow is the big day.  I can't wait.  Someway, somehow, I am going to go to that movie.
Well, I'm moving out of Jimmy's today so I won't have access to a pc.  I don't want the drunkenfish to die, but I don't know what to do about it.  I'll try to do some redesign by code on my bro's mac.  John or Jim, if you want to do anything with the df, let me know.  I might just turn the df into my own page and domain, like Jolly Jibber, instead of hosting pages.  I just haven't been involved with blog very much lately and thought maybe this is the time to disolve it as we know it.  Those on the df can get hosted with blogger if they choose or you can stay on with the df just knowing I'm not going to be too involved except in maybe keeping up my own blogging page which will become the main df page.  I'll eventually set up links to everyone I've known from both the df and tanque and hope to keep in touch, but I think this is the end of the drunkenfish as a blog community.
Can't get blogger to talk with the df server, but I'm working on it... Maybe in a month or so, I'll have a finished design here.  If your reading this then I'm on my way.
Job!  Job!  I got a job!  I told RCI that I didn't think my job history was good enough to compete for the job offered.  (meaning that I thought maybe it was a ploy to hire the person they really wanted in human resources for the job by putting up the quota of people to interview that weren't qualified to make their pick go through unchallenged; leaving me without a job at all.)  Instead I said that I want the job I came in to interview for:   $13.25 an hour on the phones.   Fine by me.... I've beat the system in my own way and now I have a JOB!!!!!!!    Wooooooooooooooha!  I am so glad to be working.  I start the job on monday (pending a drug test... I'll be sure to make it... ... ...Well, I will... really!)
Should the federal government fund human cloning?  Not yet.   Should the federal government get out of the way of companies who can prove the value, humane commitment, and security of their cloning research.  Maybe.  I definitely feel that government should investigate and regulate the industry but not draw a line in the sand that research cannot pass.
John - I'm sorry to hear about your dad's health.  Hang in there buddy.  Your dad probably wanted you to tell the rest of the family because you are such an emotionally strong person who will be able to properly inform those around you.  I really admire your ability to cope with such hardships while still keeping your mind focused on other's emotional security.  You're a great man.
Man, I can't win with these interviews.  The last interview before today's was for a Level One help desk job and I failed miserably because they didn't think I'd be able to handle the stress.  The one I went in for today was suppose to be for a low paying, low profile, call support for a Condo trading company; RCI.   I went in thinking, "no way am I going to sell myself short", so I went in with supreme confidence.  What did they do?   They decided I was Supervisor material and now I'm going in for another interview on Wednesday for a job that can make up to 65k a year managing over 80+ employees.   What the fuck?  Am I being set up for a fall?   Probably.  All I can do is go in and try to get the job.  This job hunting business is bizarre.   People are bizarre.  Life is bizarre.  I don't get it, but I'm going for it anyway.   All I want is a fucking job!!!
I think it would be wise for me to stay out of the God discussion.   I haven't read everything on the Dylan discussion so I'm not sure where I stand in that.  I will say that Dylan has certainly made rock n' roll speak from a much higher conscience than anything that ever floated to the surface of rock in the fifties.  If you look back to popular music before Dylan that wasn't considered Rock n' Roll, there is plenty of meaning.  Who know's how much of the songs Sinatra sang are in Rock n' Roll.  There are so many great lyrical tunes of the 20th century before Rock n' Roll that it's hard to give Dylan Einsteinian status knowing that he certainly didn't pull lyrical quality from a void.     - As far as my finding a career, I've decided to not stress over it and just try my best to stay in jobs that actually make money until I trip over something I enjoy.  My interview for that help desk job is today and although it is certainly not an ideal job, it will really get me out of my financial hole.
Ween Dream - I was hangin' out with Jean and Dean Ween in their house with about 15 other people.  Dean Ween's red-headed girlfriend was sitting in my lap and I was getting smirks from Dean's friends, but Dean himself didn't seem to mind.  Everybody was very drunk and Jean suggested we get more beer.  Jean and Dean and a few of their closest friends were rattling off jokes that everyone seemed to think were funny as hell, but I just didn't get them.  I was always trying to get in the groove, so I could chime in and feel apart of the party, but I only ended up smiling and pretending that I understood the humor.  After awhile of the confusing party I decided to lay down in a back room that happen to have my own bed in it without sheets or covers.  I laid down on the bed and sighed from surviving my awkward party experience when I looked up to see Dean's girlfriend sitting on a bench at the door, closing her eyes looking tired and drunk.  I moved over in the bed to let her know it was alright to crash next to me, but she opened one of her eyes and looked at the bed and said, "I don't think I can sleep with a man who can't take care of his own bed. "  I shruged, turned over, and went to sleep.  I awoke in another dream where I was with a catering crew delivering food to shops around the inskirts of a stadium while some unknown to me event was going on, but I could hear the crowd cheering.  I was leading the group of six or seven caterers around to the different shops asking who ordered food, because we had lost our list of clients.   We came to the end of a hall and I told the group I was going outside to take a break and that I'd be back soon.   I went outside and found an acoustic guitar laying against a wall.  I picked it up and wandered out near a ditch away from the stadium and belted off "Hard Days Night" better than I've ever played it.   When I was done I heard some clapping from a few janitors by a back entrance and I smiled and walked back to my service entrance on the first floor.  The catering crew was on the 3rd floor and I took the elevator up and stepped out of the elevator on the third, barely making it out before it drop back towards the first.  Seeing the crew down the hall I started walking towards them and the dream ended.
Some day, I'm going to be sitting in my own chair, in my own house, drinking my own beer, thinking my own thoughts, after working a job I can stand doing for 40 hrs out of my week.  I hope that day comes soon 'cause I'm losing the willpower and drive to survive and make things better for myself and I haven't even accomplished anything yet.  I'm trying to get back into computers because that's where the money is at, but I'm not having much luck yet.  The headhunter that has been getting me jobs just questioned my abilities from the last job I did for him.  4 out of 6 people they hired for that job quit, but I toughed it out to get in better standing with TekSystems and now I learn that those damn 20 yr old unorganized punks that ran my last job said I don't work well without supervision.  Where the hell they got that from is beyond me.  I put up with their unprofessionalism and lack of instruction without complaint and worked my ass off.  I really want to find them and kick their asses.   There's a possible help desk job interview coming up, but it just sucks that abominations like my last gig have to happen with no show for my patience or effort and even fuck up future possibilities.   I really just want to say fuck you to my imaginary person that is somehow responsible for the way this society works.  I wish I could find something that I could do to survive that removes everyone else from any decisions that affect me.   I'm a damn good worker that's smart, easy going, and reliable.   Why is so hard to find a decent job?  I'm currently working at a Vet clinic as a tech, but I cannot stand having to take shit from doctors who think they are gods.  I just keep holding in my rage, smiling, and doing the best that I can do until I can find something better.   My frustration is a big reason I never blog anymore.... afterall, who wants to read whiny crap like this everyday.
I am  Kong .   Strong and passionate, I tend to be misunderstood, sometimes even feared. I don't want to fight, I don't want to cause trouble, all I ask is a little love, and a little peace. If I don't get what I want, I get angry, and throw barrels and flaming oil at whatever's stopping me.  What Video Game Character Are You?

I Am A:  Neutral Good Elf Mage Bard    Alignment:   Neutral Good  characters believe in the power of good above all else. They will work to make the world a better place, and will do whatever is necessary to bring that about, whether it goes for or against whatever is considered 'normal'.    Race:   Elves  are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently conccern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.    Primary Class:   Mages  harness the magical energies for their own use. Spells, spell books, and long hours in the library are their loves. While often not physically strong, their mental talents can make up for this.    Secondary Class:   Bards  are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.

ahhh, the weekend.  I'm heading over to Jibber James' place to relax and be merry and forget about work.  Yes, I know I was very excited to get my job and I still am excited, but work is still work and now it's the weekend.  I'm sorry to those on drunkenfish who cannot get maintenance when they need it on their sites.  I've really let my drunkenfish responsibilities go and I don't see them improving anytime soon.  I can use my brother's mac, but I haven't been inspired to hunt down mac software of any kind.  Basically when I set up drunkenfish accounts I give all admin rights to the user, so I'm hoping most can be solved by the user.  As far as the server in Liverpool that the drunkenfish runs off of...  that's in my cousin Chris' able hands and he will probably keep that running as long as I decide to keep it there.  If there are server problems he usually catches them within the week.  That's about as good as it gets for free hosting so THANK YOU CHRIS!!!
I guess what I'd really like is to encourage everyone to get their own domain.  I don't mind at all anyone staying with the drunkenfish as long as they would like to, but they would be their own separate entity.  (eg. not drunkenfish/joeblow, but something like bynthere or Di-Havanna).  Jimmy expressed that he would like to keep his JollyJibber page his own thing and not turn it into a community.  Well, I guess I would like that too, but I want to somehow keep everyone involved and still be a community of sorts.  Again, I haven't thought this through very well, but I think the best solution would be to separate into individual pages and then regroup at a time everyone is comfortable with in forming a portal page to keep the community feeling.
I'm planning a redesign on Easter whilst recovering from my hangover from Shangri-la on Saturday.  I need all the drunkenfishies to either blog or e-mail their opinions on what we should do about the separate domains.  If they were separated, who would go where?  Should I create a new domain and invite all who wanted into that and then have the drunkenfish as a portal site for all domains created under that?  That way we could all still be drunkenfishies, but would have the freedom to be hosted by whatever domain we want or create and still be a community.  It just seems a little disturbing to have the Jibbers and the Drunkenfishies all under the drunkenfish banner.  Are the drunkenfishies the REAL Drunkenfish.... Am I making way too big a deal out of this?  Jim S. has mentioned that he might want to start another domain all together as the portal site and the Jibber and the DF would just be domains under that... hmmm... I think I would like to just separate the two, but I'm not sure.  I would suppose in that scenario the only ones who would be left as drunkenfishies would be Di-Havana, John, Hank, and myself.  I'd like to know what everyone else thinks before I redesign the site this weekend.  my email is:   urlLink mindevol@hotmail.com
New Computer!!!  I'm back in business.  Once I get all my pirated software back up and going, I think a drunkenfish redesign is in order.  Pentium 4, 1.8 Ghz, 512 MB DDR(?) memory, 21" Sony Multiscan E540 Monitor, 80 GB storage, dvd, cd rw, 10/100 ethernet, 5 USB ports, 64MB nVidia GeForce2MX Graphics Card w/TV out... cool ass sony speakers, I am in heaven.  I really don't want to go to work, but I suppose I have to pay this thing off now.  To test my system, I bought the DVD Apocalypse Now (redux), and the video game Alone in the Dark (the new nightmare), going through my bro's DSL for now.  My brother is so cool to let me buy this thing first and move out of his house later.  Probably a couple months tops.
urlLink City Populations   I just think this list is cool to peruse.
Tears filled my eyes when I saw the purple ribbon on Robyn's site saying save the Drunkenfish.  I should be getting a computer in about a month and I vow to redesign the site, find a new host, keep up with maintenance, and recruit more fishies.  I've noticed some of the fishies drifting over to the JollyJibber server, and that's fine and dandy, but for the fishies still on the df server, stability is on the way.
Does anyone know the origin of the phrase; "The whole nine yards"?  My roommates and I all had different stories and when I searched the web I found even more stories.... all different.  A few of the most believable to me are:  1. It takes 9 square yards to make a complete well made man's suit.  If you wanted your suit done right without having to make alterations you would ask the tailor to use the whole nine yards.  2.  Since the phrase didn't seem to pop up until the 40's and later, this one seems plausible to me.  The length of a machine gun belt for a fighter plane was 9 yards.  To use the whole nine yards was to use all your ammo.  3.  The most popularly accepted answer, (one that just doesn't feel right to me though) is that a cement truck holds nine cubic yards of cement.  Thus the whole nine yards was to use the entire truckload of cement for a job.  4. Another popular one that I don't buy is that it is an american football expression designed to be sarcastic since it actually takes 10 yards to accomplish a first down.  There are tons of others, but hearing a quote from a legitimate source would end the brain loop I'm going through on this one.  I suppose I could just make up my own to add to the list.  ** The whole nine yards come from (according to Ben's imagination)  -  the standard length of a shotgun shack.  To get the whole nine yards would to have meant to kill everything in the entire house with one shot.
Sean - Still thinking about the convex, concave space thing.  Just to clarify... are you asking if space is convex (meaning the shortest distance between any two points is through space) or concave (meaning the shortest distance between some points is to exit and re-enter space)?
What kind of world has this all become when I walk into a bank to start a checking account and they give me a platinum Visa credit card?  Ben Emerson with a Platinum Visa Card.  Danger, Will Rogers!  DANGER!!!
urlLink Sean  - My guess (a very undereducated one) is that the universe is filled with several different sized spheres from several big bangs originating at several moments in time.  This perspective is 3D at a frozen point in time and is only dealing with matter, not empty space.  Of course if space itself has a certain shape then those spheres could form a larger pattern expanding and flowing to the shape of that definite space.  I believe personally that space is infinite and that matter that does not have the mass to pull itself back to its source will expand forever.  Taking in all this, the over all shape of the material universe is amorphous.  Yes, this theory could probably get hit hard with dimensional relativity and time distortion and quantum theory and all, but is anyone up to it?  Sorry, if I didn't address what you were actually asking Sean.  I am only slightly familiar with the theory that I think you are referring to about curved space.
I also dreamed about owning a Rottweiller the other night that was a bit too aggressive.  I was scared of my own dog.  I was ashamed in front of Jim S. that I couldn't control it better, but my main concern in the dream was that I wasn't being very fair to the dog by having me as an emotional guide.  After waking, I wrote Hank (Chris Hill) the next day talking about my fear that I don't have the wisdom to deal with the seriousness of other people's lives.  The dream stirred something in me. (probably the seriousness of seeing the 9-11 stuff on T.V. again had some part of putting these thoughts in my head.)  The feeling was like waking up the next day after a bad acid trip at a family Thanksgiving gathering, thinking who the fuck am I to be screwing with other people's lives.  Serious, serious, serious.... damn, it's not my job to be a reality fixture for others.  I'm wondering why I'm feeling in the spot light when I really don't have anyone that relies on me in this capacity.  Perhaps being around all these new people at work has something to do with it as well.  After all I just came back from working a job that I had no social contact with others to an environment where I am surrounded by people.  Maybe that's it.  Anyway, cheers to all those self-contained floating souls that might have the same feelings of self-doubt and self-worth or perhaps might actually be concerned for the well being of others.  Row, row, row, your boat, gently down the stream...  (I'm not stoned by the way... just a load of caffine.)
This morning I'm slowly waking up.  I fixed a huge breakfast of bacon, eggs, and biscuits.  Yesterday I started my 3:30 to midnight work schedule.  Training is over and I am on the phones selling timeshare vacations.  Yuck and yea.  Hate sales, but love that I'm working with cool people and have an income.  I'm very seriously considering joining the Peace Corps in Belize.   There is an assignment there to teach computers and the internet to school kids.  2 years, food and lodging paid, $28k a year on top of that given as a stipend as I understand it.  Ahhhh, Belize, jungle, mountains, 2nd largest barrier reef in the world, Mayan ruins, English as the official language... I'm going to set up an interview with a peace corp recruiter in Chicago before the month is over.  I'm sure I'm over glorifying it, but it's something I'm going to find out everything I can before I sign the dotted line, if I sign the dotted line.  Another option to get to Belize is to just save my damn money up and move there.  I had a dream that my mother died last night and it really upset me.  I cried.  I believe it's a symbol representing my need to let go of my boyhood.  (but I e-mailed my mom to see if she was ok, just in case)  I can generally attach just about every symbol in my dreams to a part of myself or my phyche as oppose to real concern for someone else.  I don't think that is the case for everybody though.  Is the mother who dreams about not being able to find her child, truly concerned in the dream with protecting the child or is she more concerned with her self doubts and self worth?  Not sure on this one.   Might be an impossible question to answer.

I'm fairly bored and blanky staring at my brother's computer screen in a bit of silly hazy mind babble.  I've been searching the net tonight in an attempt to explain why the word wuhbuhduh always issues forth from my mouth unconsciously.  I have to admit, I haven't found much.  I went through american indian words and places thinking that's sort of the feel of the word, but didn't find much there.  I did find a town in Somalia named Wabada.  Maybe I lived there in a past life.  hmmm...  actually I just was reading the meaning of the town name and it seems to be the word for "Lion".   Maybe that was my last word in a past life and every life I've had from there out, I've been unconsciously screaming it.

I get to watch Clay's dog and house for this week.  Wahhhoooooo!  Party at Clay's!  Well, I can't smoke inside and it's raining out, but I can party in the garage... hmmm... I could have done that at Matt's too.  I think I'm going to stay in Indy for awhile 'cause the money is rollin' in and I'm searching for apartments now.

Man, Ruidoso sounded so good.  There's just one little thing that makes it difficult to see me living there.  It has less than 5000 people and there's no big cities anywhere near it.  I was thinking it was at least 100,000 because I book alot of vacations there for RCI.  I just can't see living in a town that small.  I suppose I just have to start day dreaming about another location to settle down.  San Diego is still floating around the brain.
Read a couple articles on lucid dreaming today.  The articles weren't that interesting, but I did learn a new technique to keep from waking up when you feel yourself losing the dream.  It's called dream spinning.  In the dream, hold your arms out and spin.  This in itself is a good way to get back into the dream.  Another recommended addition to that is to always have a person, time, and place in mind that you will always go to after spinning.  Say, Bob Dylan, at a smoky club, in the early 70's.  It's apparently a very good way to stay in the dream and regain focus.  I just thought Jim S. might be interested in hearing that technique.  I haven't tried it yet, but I intend to.
Well, the Peace Corps thing fell through because I would have to clear my $15,000 debt before they would let me join and I don't see that occurring anytime soon.  My eyes are starting to focus on becoming a mailman here in Indy for awhile and then doing the same in Ruidoso.  That's my new fantasy (could be reality in a year or so) place to live.  I want to learn to be a top notch spelunker someday and the Carlsbad caves are very near Ruidoso, plus my family owns 50 acres of land in the desert in a nearby Texas county.  Plus it's just gorgeous.  Here's a picture of Ruidoso, Southern New Mexico.
Had a blast with Ned, Shari, Uwe, and Jim out on the boat. If Ned and I had our way, we would have invaded those pathetic old people's homes on the hills, but we didn't want to scare the straights in the boat, so we gave up the idea.  Thanks Jim for the trip.

The greatest trick I ever learned in dealing with someone you're sleeping with alot and you really like him/her, but you're not quite sure if him/her likes you the same way is to mouth the words "olive oil".  If that person says "I love you too", then you're in.  If that person has a shocked look on his/her face, then you say, "Olive oil, baby.  Let's get the olive oil."  (I know that's an old one, but that's all I could come up with and I felt like posting something)

Thanks Ned for having me over for the game party.  Yes, of course I found it my duty to start drinking wine early and as fast as I could.  Someone has to do it.  I went with Sonya and Sean downtown for a brief moment where Sonya and I went off to use a restaurant's restrooms.  Sonya beat me to the rest room and so I thought I could quickly dart over to another restaurant and be back to join the group again.  Well, that didn't happen.  I found the restaurant, but they made me buy a drink to use the restroom and of course I wasn't going to leave a perfectly good drink sitting at the bar without it's buddy Ben.  So I drank it and then took a cab back to Shangri-La.  This brief downtown venture should have been enough to sober me up enough to decide to quit drinking for the night.  I was well aware that I was way over my limit, but I had to play some bad harmonica on the front porch and of course one can't do that properly without a drink.  That's the last thing I remember.  Then I woke up in my clothes (thank goodness for that) on a bed.  I'm picturing me getting up very politely and bidding everyone a good night and then walking to that bed on my own power and bowing out for the night graciously.  If anyone is wanting to tell me the real story, I beg you not to.  Good Luck I.U.!!!!!!  Thanks again for the invite Ned.
Happy Birthday Ned!!!!
John, I'm glad you loved London.  Just wanted to mention that where I was in England, it all shut down at 11:00.  I'm talking "Ghost Town."  After 11pm there was absolutely no one on the street left except drug addicts, vagrants, and Ben.  (was that redundant?) I would suppose that in every major city that the night life continues.  Even Manchester had a night life after 11pm, but it was too much of a pain for me to get there without a car and expect to make it back to my flat.  I so wish that I could have made it down to London while I was in England.  That is probably my biggest regret about my stay there.  By the way, may favorite part about England was seeing so much history still standing and the Indian Food.  Oh yeah, and being so close to Amsterdam was kinda fun too.

I'm finding I like the Star Wars Jedi Knight II, Jedi Outcast better than I liked Attack of the Clones.  The game is a blast.  It gets about 10x more fun when you finally get your jedi powers and light saber.  I'm still in my in between travel, living out of my suitcase stage and I'm still not goal oriented or focused on anything.  I do finally see the light of where I'm going to settle down for a little while and make a temporary home for myself.  Downtown Indy!  Mainly because I have a job here and until I find something else, I might as well experience downtown Indy.  Move-in date is set for July 1st.  I'm still waiting to be sitting on my own livingroom floor drinking a beer and sighing comfortably that I am home.
Happy Mother's Day all!  I sent my mom a basket of flowers via the internet and she e-mails me back with, "thanks for the two baskets of flowers!"  I'm thinkin'..."two?"  They're 60 bucks a piece.  "Ummm... your welcome mom."  What am I going to do?  Send it back.  Anyhow, it's rare I do anything for me mum, so why not.    Here's some more movie ratings of stuff I've seen lately.

Spiderman - 12 Changing Lanes - 22  Also in the video games catagory with the same rating system but how many jack and cokes to be the best video game ever -  American McGee's Alice - 8  (finished it though in two sittings. worst part is the super cool graphically rendered big bad guys take very little strategy to kill except to run like crazy around in circles saving up for another big blast at 'em.) Alone in the Dark (the new nightmare) - 26 (creepy, but I'm always getting stuck on something stupid you have to figure out.) Triple Play - 20 (relaxing... this game has a definite jack and coke bell curve in it's favor because of how easy it is to play.)
Man, I would love to work for a video game company,  urlLink Bill .  I've always dreamed of that.  Congrats!  That's so cool.  I wish you happiness, luck, and loads of cash with the job.

I rented 3 movies last night.  1. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back - (Teenagerish crap, but that made me smirk about ten times throughout the movie)  2. Zoolander - (Had a smile on my face for most of the movie, but I never seemed to get into it.)   ** by the way, I suppose I'm too intellectually challenged to make any meaningful comments about these movies, but this is what you get on wuhbuhduh. ... and the last movie, which had the same premise as Zoolander, but is in a completely different league was - 3. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion - I absolutely loved this movie.  Granted I was a little drunk, but the banter between Woody and Helen Hunt reminded me of the old Woody Allen flicks.  I laughed and laughed throughout this flick.   On Ben's rating scale - (how many Jack and Cokes do you need before this flick is the best movie you've ever seen.) -  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back - 32 Zoolander - 24 Curse of the Jade Scorpian - 13  (please note that the above ratings are adjusted by adding the number of jack and cokes I've already had while watching the movie.)

Hey all!  No excuses for not blogging, but anyway...  Never moved into a place of my own yet.  My brother is buying the house next to him and I'll be moving in there before September.  I need to find a roommate before then.  Rent being $325 a piece / a month.  Cool house:  wooden floors, screened front porch, half finished basement, 2 bedrooms.  I'm dreading putting an ad in the paper and then having to interview a bunch of freaks.  I've never really had any problems with complete strangers moving in, so I'm sure this will work out.   A band is slowly forming together here in Indy.  I absolutely cannot calm myself down about it.  I am totally siked.  It's been about 4 years or so for me and I am way looking forward to it.  It's a loose net of people who can come and go as they please, but I'm hoping everyone enjoys it enough to hang out and attend the one practice a week schedule.   urlLink Jim S.  is going to be doing most of the guitar stuff and we have a friend of mine Paul Arnone on the Bass, and a friend of mine's boyfriend from work, named Jeff, who seems to be in the right creative song workshop mode that I consider myself to be in.  Official practice probably won't begin until I can set up the studio in the basement of the new house, but I'm sure we'll get together a few times before that to hammer out details and begin work on learning parts to songs.   I just put in for my vacation down by  urlLink John Shannon  in Palm Beach Shores for the week of Halloween.  If anyone wants to join me, they are welcome.  I've reserved a 1 bedroom for 4 at the Radisson there.  I believe it is Saturday to Saturday, with Halloween in the middle somewhere, but I'll have to check my calender.  It's still beautiful at that time of year there and all water and beach activities are still going on.  It's a mighty spiffy resort too, so there is tons of stuff to do.

hmmm... DF is back up on it's old server.  I believe Chris Lea moved it from Liverpool to Baton Rouge, but I don't have the details.  Anyway, I purchased a hosting service for a year and will move it over to that when I get the chance.  DF has had a free ride it's entire life, but I believe I told Chris Lea that it would only be a few months when I first set it up on his server.  If Chris Lea reads this.... Thank you so much for giving the DF a home for free.  I'm assuming that I will not be receiving a back dated bill from you in the mail.  I'll be hosting with Your-Site.com in a couple of days for about $5 a month.  Not too bad.  Cheers!

Did I ever mention how much I love The Onion?  Sales Disappointing For First-Ever Hustler Swimsuit Issue LOS ANGELES\97Spokespersons for Larry Flynt Publications are struggling to explain the poor sales of Hustler magazine's first annual swimsuit issue, crammed from cover to cover with beautiful young women modeling the latest sexy swimwear. "We are utterly baffled," LFP public-relations director Kenneth Micklos said of the issue, which sold 17 newsstand copies nationwide. "Our readership demographic is overwhelmingly heterosexual and male, with a strong interest in looking at beautiful women. It's a mystery."
oh ma gawd!  Angel just called about the room. She's a young rock n' roller from Illinois.  She's going to call back about coming to see the house.  C'mon little girl.... everything is cool.... c'mon.....
Talked to three perspective roommates.  Two losers in their 40's that have no musical talent, work for themselves, and want to take over the band that hasn't started yet (Rednecks!!!).  Who'd a thunk it living on the east side.  There is one straight forward businessman, but I haven't decided about him yet.  He asked a ton of questions which I suppose is good, but was constantly trying to unveil what was wrong with my offer.  He seemed a little too much Type "A" personality.  I just want a responsible hippie.  Is that too much to ask?
My ad comes out next sunday and wednesday in the paper for a roommate.  This is kind of exciting.  Who is going to call about the room?  I mentioned in the add that the new person would get the master bedroom, but that they would have to put up with a rock band in the basement.  Rent $325.  I'm hoping for a teenage beauty queen who has a thing for alcoholics.  In realistic terms, a really laid back person is all I want.
urlLink Here's a plug for my dad's upcoming book as well.
I was searching the internet for the singer I mentioned before and I finally found him.   urlLink Ralph Stanley!!!
urlLink Brad  - I'm not sure if we discussed this before, but I went and saw the "Down from the Mountain" tour when it came to Indy.  I absolutely loved it.  Alot of the focus of the show was the original performers of the music from "O' Brother, Where Art Thou?"  One of the best concerts, I've ever seen.  Just sittin' back with a brewski, listening to awesome and strange vocal harmonies mixed with various mountain string instruments and percussion.  The highlight of the evening was some old guy who everyone praised as the king of Bluegrass.  I wish I could remember his name.  He came out and sang all by himself without any instrumental or vocal backups for his first number.  I don't believe I have ever heard a more soulful voice.
Why does the government always warn of a terrorist attack everytime I'm about to step on a plane?  I can just see it now; some bearded dude grabs a lady and Ben slinks off into the bathroom where he curls up into a fetal position and starts whining like Bernard Shaw.  or maybe I'll get up and tackle the terrorist and wrestle him to the ground saving the whole plane.  or maybe it will just be a long comfortable flight and I'll get some reading done.  *sigh*.  I've got an econo flight to West Palm via a three hour wait in the Dallas/Ft.Worth airport.
Well, alright!  I'm off of work for 10 days straight.  Got all the RCI stuff worked out.  I'll see ya in West Palm Beach on Friday night, John.
Man!!! I am so sick of not being able to talk to a human being at RCI.  Everything is automated and me being in the peon position that I'm in, I'm not allowed to talk to real people.  I have to fill out forms and wait for days for a response that is usually totally screwy and then I have to fill out forms again to correct the misunderstanding.  I'm trying to get off for vacation.  I asked for the 11th - 14th of October.  My normal days off would be th 8th, 9th, and 10th and then the 15th, 16th and 17th.  That would give me 10 days off!!!  Wahooo.... or at least it would be wahoo if I could get someone to understand my request.  I got an e-mail back saying "ok, you can have the 11th, 13th and 14th off and the 7th.  Where's the fucking 12th?!?!  What, I'm suppose to fly back from Florida so I can work the 12th...  MORONS!!!  What a shity system.  I just filled out another form saying, I don't want the 7th off, please give me the 12th off.  In another week of waiting for a response it's just not going to matter.  I suppose I'll just have to call in sick on the 12th.  I am going to go ahead and buy plane tickets anyway as soon as I here from John.  I somehow forgot to ask him about all this planning.  I did get a room at the Radisson from the 13th to the 20th.  I'm planning on giving the room to John and his wife for the last three days.  I won't go into the trouble I had trying to get that room.  Never what I want at RCI, just what I get.  It's hard to complain about the room though... $125.00 for an entire week at a resort that normally cost $165 per night.
I'm working a new job now at Conseco.  Customer Service Rep... yee haw.  The basement band is going well, but we can't come up with a name.  I wanted to call the band "Booby".  That idea didn't go over well with our Board of Directors (Drummer's girlfriend, Bass player's wife).  The new name is "The Dangerous Kitchen", which I admit, I chuckled and liked at first, but now I think it's a bit like the random generated band names you can do online.  I don't know.  If anyone has any cool band names, pleeeeeeeese, give me some suggestions.  I'm not huge on the importance of a band name, but we do have to put something on the cd cover.  The cd release, (meaning, when we pass them out to friends and family who want them) will probably be around the first of the year instead of the Thanksgiving date we had thought previously.  Our sound is sort of Nirvana/Beatles.
Wow!  What a cool feeling to have people write on your web page.  I somehow missed this whole comments phenomenon until now.  Thanks for welcoming me into this by posting comments.  Anyway, the job frustration built up in my head too much to just cruise along with, so I went ahead and quit.  I've got 2 months worth of savings, so I won't need any income for that amount of time.  I hooked up with a bartending agency for 60 something bucks that sends me a manual and a bartending kit and a test for certification.  I know, it sounds like I just got ripped off, but they guarantee placement in your area within two weeks of certification.  Since I don't really know jack about serving alcohol (it's usually straight from the bottle to the mouth for me), I thought this couldn't hurt me.  I'm going to do alot of searching on my own to find a bar I would be comfortable with.  I figure wherever I get placed probably won't be the bar I'll want to stay at.  So basically, I'll use my first location as a means of learning the trade.  If I like the place, then great.  If I don't, then by then I'll have some experience and I'll seek out a more comfortable working environment.  What I dread most about being a bartender is in going from white collar jobs to blue collar jobs, the character of the boss seems to always change.  I'm almost certain to start off with a redneck asshole for a boss, but that's how that goes.  I'm ready for it.
I feel like Dudley Moore in "Bedazzled" with all the jobs I've had.  If it's not one thing it's another.  Nothing seems to go quite right.  Everytime I get going on a job, there comes a moment when I just look up at the sky, extend my toungue and go Thpppppbbpbpthpbpb!!!  This Conseco Customer Service job sucks!  First off, they have a million different companies they've acquired all with their own 1980's circa computer applications.  No information is easy to obtain.  It's a matter of finding the right program, scrolling through reams of data looking for the code that signifies what type of policy and then the actual info you need is buried in reams of more code.  The whole time the customer thinks you're an idiot for taking so long to get the answer to a simple question.  Also, most every person that gets on the phone with me is stinking mad.  Conseco sold all these Universal life policies in the 80's projecting great things with the policy by estimating the interest rates would stay at 7% or more.  The interest rates now are about 3%, so everyone is getting notices that their policies are out of money and that they need to start paying alot more premiums if they want to keep their policies from lapsing.  Well, thpbpbpbpthpbpbp!!!  I want out of this stupid job.  The pay is great and the benefits are awesome, but I don't want to do this everyday.  I've decided that I want to be a bartender.  Not the safest choice of jobs for me, but I'm going to do it anyway.
Personally, I don't see the big deal about actually going through with making identical clones of a person.  I see alot of the negatives, but I don't see the positives.  I can see that there are many medical advancements that can be made in the field of cloning, but I don't see the purpose of actually going all the way with making the actual clone.  Hmmm... would I want an exact clone of myself.... maybe.  I'd have to involve a woman with the gestation anyway, so I might as well just fuck her and share our genes.  It's evolution baby!!   I'm usually never one to stand in the way of science, but in this case, the potential suffering without (to me) a usuable goal is pointless.  I'm a bit of a sociopath when it comes to my beliefs in what should be sacrificed in the name of science, but with this already overpopulated world, I don't see the significance needed to allow such a human experiment.  ... and how about that Raelian Cult.  Yeah, whatever... to me it's just the same as all religions except they've gone back to the human sacrifice.
I'm staying at my brother's house while he's in New Orleans.  Just a good way to get some time to myself and take care of his dog.  I came home on the 23rd to find a business card on his front door.  Kim Dotson of the United States Office of Personnel Management.  This is what the card says word for word. "The U.S. Government is conducting a background investigation on a person you may know.  Please call my office during the business day and leave a message of where and when I may contact you to arrange an interview." Who are they after... could it be me?  Probably not, but this really puts the image of Facism in my head.  Next we'll be having to show our papers in random inspections.  'knock, knock, knock... open up, Homeland  Security!'
Well, I've been drunk most of these holidays.  Big surprise.  My thoughts meander around what I might write about, what I might do to express myself, and what's the point.  Sometimes I look at American culture as a society that is chasing shadows.  Do we understand what big purposes we fight for or live for.  I guess all I can talk securely about is what I feel strongly about.  I wish I could pin that down.  I personally just entertain myself by watching VH1 shows on old bands, I play the newest video games to entertain myself and escape from the looming ghostly goal of progressing myself.  We went from the father figures of the 40's and 50's to the rebellious children of the 60's to the recovering ease off of the 70's to the selfishness of the 80's to the fake, but trully felt love of the world to escape ourselves in the 90's to what I hope is clear vision of what the fuck is going on of this decade.   I may be way off, but I find myself wondering what the hell do I really care about in this world.  Stop the war, comes to mind.  Stop killing each other... but what is the real goal.  For me, and I know this doesn't play into much that we can do first hand, but it is to make the human race survive long enough to actually discover a purpose and focus, worthy of humankind.  Survival might be a good start.  Anyway, back to the focus of song lyrics, what the fuck do I write about these days.  I don't have a girlfriend, family, any of the stuff that everyone else around me seems to have.  I do have the anger of the youth, but I'm completely out of touch with what their anger is and am way too in touch with my own personal anger of underacheivement.  (That was just me complementing myself in thinking that I have the ability to be something great, but I just haven't realized what that thing is.)  This is not thinking that's getting anywhere, but I thought I'd share the effort by actually going ahead and posting this ramble.
I just had a chat with my Uncle Sim and he says that the tooth rat thing is a german tradition that my Grammy passed down.  I love that.... the Tooth Rat.   What a wonderful thing that I actually believed in as a child.
Between writing on notebook paper at work like a little kid, stuff like Ben Emerson - Guitar, vocals... etc... and writing my band name in every style imaginable, I am in love with having a band again.  I know it sounds like I'm really into myself, but so what.  I'm very happy to be in a band again.  The name of the band is Penny Strange and the cd will be called Fledgling.  It's all about being 20 something from suburbia and experiencing the city.   We're going to try to write a title song, but the cd is already strong without it.  The new date, now that we have a sound man that has put things in perspective for us, is going to be sometime this summer.  I will throw a huge bash that all will be invited to.  I know it is so much cooler to release good music quietly and just say, "yeah, here it is... whatever."  I'm too egocentric for that.  I want to make a giant event of it.
Merry Festivus or Winter Solstice or Christmas or whatever you like to celebrate.  Is Santa Claus God?  Is Santa Claus a saint?  What's the difference between saints and gods.  They both have magical powers and people still believe in them...  That would kinda put a damper on the whole one God belief and how superior this monotheism is to all those ancient belief systems.... but I digress.  Well for me, I guess Santa Claus is the only god I ever knew... oh yeah and the tooth rat.  (We had a bit of a warped family and the tooth fairy was never mentioned.   I think that was my Uncle Sim's doing.... it really sounds like his work.)   Anyway,  I would like to share my love for all the bloggers.  I don't write much, but I very much enjoy reading what everyone has to say in their daily perception of what's going on.  The world is a wonderful place for me.  I absolutely love watching everyone flow past and back again from my choice of a spot to settle.  I've been a driftin' most of my life and for once I am standing still to see what's going on.  I'm really finding I love humanity.  There is so much good in every person I come in contact with.  Either I've picked a very good spot to observe from or I'm getting a good sample of the norm.   In either case, I love you all.  Merry Christmas.
...and drunk
Google is so much fun when you're drunk.  Just make up a word... pull it from the depths of your soul and spell it out.  Then hit the google search button and see what pops up.  It's just a fun way to surf.  Even if the first page that pops up is not interesting.  Sometimes it leads to something.   ok... maybe I'm just really bored.
Well, the job hunt is going awful.  I've sent out over 100 resumes and I've only had one interview so far.  I went through that today and have another with the same company thursday.  Life Insurance again.  Uggghhh.  This time I'd actually be selling and renewing policies.  Since it's my only lead so far, I suppose I have to do my best in the interviews and go for it.  My old job at RCI might be a possibility also.  RCI has a rule that if you quit, which I did, then you can return within a year.  I'll have to go before a review board or something like that to prove I really am worthy of taking back, but I'm willing to do that if it means getting a paycheck.   The band is kind of on the rocks as well.  Paul, the bassist, has alot of family obligations and can't dedicate the time needed to do the project.  We're still trying to work something out, but I'm behind whatever decision he makes.  I hope he stays.  If Paul goes, Jeff and I decided not to get a new bassist, and just try to record everything on our own.  Maybe it might work to just bring Paul back when we play live.  We'll see.
I'm drunk as usual, but  I can't see losing byn over something stupid.  Come back Byn... I need you.  Please don't forsake us.... You're a huge part of why I still blog.   I want you, I need you.... please come back.  I don't write much, but I read and you're the best personality around for me.  I love reading your blog.   Don't go.  You blog a little like I do.  What's on your mind and very honest.  I love your blogs.  I won't go on and on, so this is it.... my final plea.... it would very much hurt to see you stop blogging.  Please don't.

I know anyone who reads this page is sick of hearing about me searching for a job, but today that officially ends.  I got the job at Safeco and start March 10th.  I still have to wait tables for a few weeks though starting tonight to make ends meet.  ok... that's the end of this job search stuff.  Next topics will probably move on to the War.  The most surface thing about the upcoming war to me is that the views of left and right are so far apart, it's scary.  What that means to me is that pretty much most people don't have any real information.  I know that when my roommate talks about it, he is quoting conservative radio, and I know that he knows that when I talk about it, I am quoting liberal journalists.  (mainly articles on commondreams.org)  I read the New York Times online everyday, but they are mainly trying to keep up with the ongoing events instead of answering the questions of why.  Maybe only the privileged decision makers are allowed real information these days.  You might as well ask the guy bagging your groceries as read an editorialist.
I believe I have 3 jobs now.  I do a final interview with the main one Wednesday.  Thanks Chris H. for the job lead at Safeco.  I really hope that one is the one.  Meanwhile, I start work part time at a bookstore tomorrow and I have a job at Lone Star, waiting tables, that starts sometime at the end of the week.  I made it.  Barely.  I didn't even sell anything.  Amazing.  My brother/landlord gave me a bit of a breather on the rent, so I'll have to make it up to him.  Thanks bro.
After mulling through the potential democratic candidates, I have to say that Kerry looks the best so far.  Sen. Edwards from North Carolina looks fresh and I agree with what I know he has voted for, but I think he lacks accomplishments.  I like Gephardt, but he's actually a little too conservative on some issues if that's believable.  Gephardt is certainly the torch holder for the liberal democrats, but I think he's run enough times to prove he really can't win.  Other names like Dodd, or Biden, I'll have to look into a little more.   Leiberman doesn't have a chance.  I suppose he's more middle of the road, but he doesn't have the charisma to pull the presidency off.  Anyway, those are my initial thoughts on the matter.  I'm sure they'll change as I learn more.
Well, I've got alot of promises from jobs, but so far no one has locked into a final interview yet.  It seems this snow has put everyone in the frame of mind that it's more important to just get through the day, rather than bother with interviews and such.  I have four jobs all pending an interview and every one of them has told me that they will call me.  I've called every one back, and they tell me someone will call.  I've even gone in person to get the ball rolling, covered in snow, and they tell me.... we need to have a meeting about this.... we'll call you.   I really need an uzi or a sawed off shot gun to make my point understood, I think.  I've had interviews that promised second interviews and those are the ones I am most hopeful for.  Right now waiting tables is the most important job to get because it will give me instant cash from tips.  I have a head hunter looking for jobs that promises to land me a $28,000 a year job within two weeks if I'm good at interviews.  We even practiced some interviews.  I swear, I have lost total respect for the corporate world.  No one ever asks straight interview questions like, " what would you do if this common situation happened in the job you're applying for?"  or "what do you expect out of this job?" ...  or "what are your career goals?"   nope.  they would rather try to build a psychological profile from statistics and corporate passed along methods in determining what kind of worker you will be.  Questions like what type of animal would you be or what would your friends say are your major faults, are questions that elicit learned responses.  They don't give you time to sit and think of a real answer.  What they want is for you to spout the answers they expect to hear straight off the end of your toungue.  A long considerate pause of contemplation makes you tagged as "an idiot."  I do well in interviews as a whole, but I still think corporate psychological tracking and tagging is just plain stupid.  If people answered these questions honestly then maybe it might give them data that they could use.  If they asked me what my friends thought my major flaws were, I should say that's personal information and it's none of your damn business.  Of course that would be telling the truth and that would be the real data they were looking for.  Instead, I'd probably laugh and say something like, "they'd say I can't dance."  I'd get a chuckle from them which lightens the mood and creates the likable atmosphere I wanted, and then I'd say something like, "I guess they might say that I'm too detailed oriented.  I like to wrap every project up into a nice neat package and my friends can find that annoying sometimes."  *smile* (sparkle from teeth)

Strange dream:  I am semi-sick and have the day off so I've been napping most of the day.  I just thought, like spab, I'd share a dream I had.  It was kind of like groundhog's day (the movie) but with only ten minutes to relive.  The first part of it was me talking to an unknown friend walking down a port city street.  I could smell the sea water in the air.  It was just a lovely day and we were walking past shops talking about  various social encounters and the lives of other people we knew, etc...  Then I notice that my friend has an awestruck look of horror in his face and he's looking over my back, above me.  I turned around and wham!  I felt an extreme slam to my left shoulder and everything turned bright yellow-white for less than a second and then I was suddenly down the street and again it was a lovely day, and I was by myself and I realized that I had the same ten minutes to live over again.   I knew that in ten minutes there was going to be that same nuclear bomb that had just happen to hit me square in the shoulder, dropped on the city again, but really for the first time.  I saw a plane landing nearby and thought to myself that if I could get to the airport, maybe I could steal a plane and escape or maybe even fly towards the thing and save some lives by making it blow up in the air.  I knew I probably would never be able to intersect it, but at least I could try and I could have escaped knowing I tried something.  I got to the airport and found the only accessible plane was a fighter jet.  I thought I knew a little bit about planes, enough to perhaps get it off the ground.  I figured if I screwed up and crashed then "oh well", I would have died in the bomb explosion anyway.  I spent the rest of the 10 minutes sitting in the cockpit trying to get the engine started.  I couldn't figure that out even and then I saw the bomb come down and wham!  bright yellow white flash, and then I was sitting in a bar across from a hot woman and I realized I had the same ten minutes to live over again.  (I'll shorten this ten minutes)  Long story short, we went up to her apartment and I got off just as the building began to shake violently and then I was on a boat in the harbor and I realized I had the same ten minutes.  This time I just sat there on the deck and smelled the sea air and looked at the sky and at the people walking on the docks and I just watched my entire ten minutes, not thinking about a whole lot, just trying to appreciate the world.   Wham!  bright yellow-white light and then I woke up from my nap for real.
Is it wrong for a 35 yr old man to like  urlLink Tatu ?  I think it is.  I mean if I loved their music and all, maybe that would be something, but I don't recall ever liking the sound of drum machines and Abba vocals, so.... yes, it is wrong for me to like  urlLink Tatu ... I think.
um... Happy Birthday Jibber!!!  I forgot that your birthday was in May.
Well, I've never been good at making money, but I've always paid my debts.  It's looking like pretty bleak times here for me money-wise so I'm cutting back on all luxuries.  That includes the internet.  If anyone e-mails me, just know that response time is going to be very slow because I'll be checking e-mail at my bro's house every now and again.  If anyone has any job leads for me, e-mail me at mindevol@hotmail.com.   I haven't done anything with the drunkenfish in some time now, but I think I'm going to let anyone who wants to play with it for awhile do so.  Just to let everyone know, if big changes occur (which they might not at all), I have nothing to do with what is going to happen to the site.  Peace.
On the warpath again for a job.  If future employers knew how many jobs I have had in my lifetime, they would laugh in my face.  Blogger looks way different than I remember.  I actually accidently came to blogger trying to get my free hoodie for being a bloggerpro member and ended up on this posting screen.  Maybe it's fate that I will start posting again or maybe not, but here's a post.

I'm moving to New Orleans in the next week or so.  I really wanted to make my album here in Indy before I left, but it never happened.  Our bass player took his recorder when he quit and he had all the tracks on his hard drive.  I had sixteen songs in total for the cd.  I did however receive a cd from a friend of a recording from our third practice.  We had learned 7 of my songs at that point, but the recording is bad and it is recorded through one mike in the middle of the room.  Everything is live and dirty.  Please excuse some of the bad singing notes I produced.  They make me cringe when I hear them, but like I said:  Live and Dirty.  So without further delay.... here is the only recording of Penny Strange.  The cd would have been titled Fledgling.    vocals and guitar - Me drums - Jeff Coyler bass - Paul Arnone  Sorry for all the repeated lyrics... we were just working on structure in this practice and I didn't know all the lyrics to the songs.  Also, the computer I'm putting this on the web from doesn't have sound, so I have no clue what song is titled what, but this is the songlist in no particular order.

Damn this State!!!   Here I was all up for trying to win Louisiana over to the democrats and some bumfuck Republican (I'm just guessing republicans are responsible)  rejects Al Sharptons bid for the State Primary.  I guess his check wasn't certified and his main headquarters address wasn't on the form.  This is the presidential race and we've seen him on every debate!  In a state where most of the African American population doesn't feel it's worth voting anyway because the system is against them, I do believe this will convince at least half to not vote come election day.  The African American vote turn out is the largest factor in getting the Louisiana demo vote in the election.  Jesus, why couldn't we just work it out over the phone with Mr. Sharpton's staff.  What the hell!!!!  I'm so pissed, I could throw this computer through the window.  I may be overblowing this because I have no editorials backing me up on this thought, but it just seems the situation to me.
Damn this Macintosh!!!  I accidentally hit clear as I was writing the last sentence of a very long post.  I'm not going to write all that again.  Here's a brief synopsis. 1. Kerry is still my man, although I like Dean as well.  I'm worried that neither can win a southern state.  I'm prepared to volunteer on the weekends to help get New Orleanians registered and actually voting, because I feel that is the best thing I can do to get this state to swing away from Bush.  2. I start my prison orientation this week.  CPR, how to handcuff prisoners, etc...  I won't be dealing with prisoners directly, but in any prison environment it is always good to be prepared.  3.  I have a possible lead on a place to live in Uptown for May.  It's nothing definite, but I was offered this place last time I lived here and it's a possibility this time.  It's a renovated horse stable behind a large house in a nice section of town near Audubon Park and Tulane University. (the area I lived last time in N.O.) It has a cool brick courtyard and a fountain with beautiful gardens.  I'm not religious, but for this cool of a place and for this cheap of rent, I will pray.  The cheap rent comes from having to keep watch on the larger house.  4.  Being on this Mac makes it difficult for me to change my site much or post.  One thing is that I don't have web tools and software for Mac and I am only able to use it about twice a week, because my brother works from home on it almost 24/7.   I haven't been very good at posting anyway, so no big change there, but I know Jeff wanted me to get rid of all that clown stuff on my site and restart that section with all the new music they're creating in his basement laboratory.
oh, hell yes.  Thank you Spirit!!!  I was beginning to think that failure after failure would mean unbearable withdrawl of financial support for mars exploration.  More successes mean more money.  I don't have much hope for Beagle, but my fingers are still crossed.  Oh yeah, and GEAUX TIGERS!!!
I remember going out to a parade with Jason King last time I was in New Orleans and seeing this great big gang of kids walking along following some teenagers.  They were terrorizing people in cars.  Beating on people's windows and screaming at them while not letting them drive on.  Jason wanted to go kick their asses, but I think I talked him out of it.   Anyway, the same type of gang  was walking along the Muses parade yesterday and they ended up shooting 4 people in a scuffle and killing one woman.  If this is a growing trend, Mardi Gras will soon come to an end.  One reason is that no one will want to go out to the parades, but more importantly the parade Krewe's will get sued (because that's where the money is at) and then they'll just quit when it becomes too financially draining.  The police were there in no time and arrested 4 teenagers with guns:  Ages 19,17,17,15.  They have told me at the bars I've been frequenting lately that just about everytime they get robbed, it's by a kid with a gun.  Another thing that scares me about Mardi Gras is that crowd on Bourbon street.  It is so jammed packed with people that if there was a fire or someone caused a panic by shooting off a gun then the death toll would be catastrophic.  Also it scares me that all those unsuspecting drunken tourists who wander away from the French Quarter, away from the river, across St. Claude,  have no idea what they are walking into.
Mardi Gras is coming up.  Can't wait.  It's been awhile for me.  Anyone I know who will be in N.O. and will want to hang out, let me know.   The Vieux parade already went by my house.  That's the only parade that's allowed to go through the Quarter.  My bro had a bunch of Louisiana and New Orleans history books lying around when I arrived here and I poured through them all.  I can't remember  when in my life I've actually read 4 books in one month.  No money, with nothing to do, can do that to a person, I suppose.  Common themes throughout Louisiana history: 1. Racism 2. Extreme Political corruption 3. Bad financial ventures 4. Mosquitoes/Yellow fever 5. Slave labor of the Irish for canal building- African Slaves were too valuable a property to have them die so often and there were always new Micks off the boats daily. 6. Biblical Flooding 7. Excessive violence, drinking and drug use 8. Music and Theatric hub of the South 9. Awesome food 10. Cypress Trees, Sugar, Cotton, ...and later Rice then Oil. Today the largest industry is Tourism.
Two new bloggers on drunkenfish coming up.   urlLink Andrew Scott  and  urlLink Brad Morrow .  Both Geography majors in college.

I'm having trouble with my Flash program and I totally screwed my brother's brand new laptop by trying to download a cd key from the internet.  Surprise! Loads of new software was automatically installed.  It's probably what I get for trying to make my tutorial version permanent.  Luckily my bro didn't have anything on the computer, so we wiped the whole thing clean and now it's fine.  Sometimes my impatience makes me stupid.  What can I say?  I went to hear some NPR host (Sarah Vowell) speak at NOCCA.  (New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts.)  She was funny as hell.  One quote of hers that is helping me cope with my letting the porn industry into my brother's laptop is, "Is there a pile of skulls?"  Looking back through history at all the evil people in the world and then looking at my own crime helps my guilt fade away.

Here's an article from the Onion for  urlLink Jimmy S.    Study: Owning A Boat Not Worth It  YONKERS, NY\97According to a study published in the April issue of Boating Magazine, owning a boat is not even close to worth it. "Our study proved conclusively that boat-ownership is primarily an inconvenience and a monetary black hole," editor Roger Bernbaum said. "We found little to no reason to keep that thing sitting in a shed all winter just so you can tow it to the lake and pay outrageous docking fees three weekends a year. It'd be much more cost-efficient to don a yachting cap and hang out at the dockhouse." The May issue of Boating promises to explore the financial viability of seaside vacation homes.
Man, those huge monstrosities that work out in the weight room here at the prison really are a pain.  The main trainer is pretty cool.  He might give me a pointer now and again.  But there's this big loud guy that always has to make a giant issue out of me leaving within an hour of me showing up.  I keep telling him, "yeah, well, I've got a schedule to keep."  But everytime, we have to go through the same shit again.  "Where you goin'?  Proud smirk and laughter to his friends,  "You just got here white boy!"  He's white also.  I just nod now with a smirk that whispers, "idiot."  Then there's the guy who always wears his sunglasses to workout indoors.  I wouldn't have a problem with that at all, but he always gets on something right after me and triples the weight.  Don't know why the sunglasses add to that annoyance, but it does.  If they only knew what effort it takes for me even to show up to workout then they probably.... they probably would still be assholes.

We'll see.  I really like the place though.  Washer/Dryer hook ups, dishwasher, central a/c and heat, upstairs huge bedroom with windows, (no windows on first floor though.)  It's a converted garage actually, that I have to open a barn-like door to get in.  It's all new and clean and the location is about 6 houses down from my brother Matt's in the Marigny.

I know this is a really simple thing to say, because the Iraq war is a very complex situation, but I want some reporter to just ask Bush point blank again:  "Could you please explain to the American people exactly why you chose to go to war with Iraq?"   It obviously wasn't to help the Iraqi people be rid of a dictator.  Sorry, don't buy that one at all.  It's not because they posed an immediate threat to the United States.  Intellegence reports were found to be contrary to that belief at the time the decision to go to war was made.  I believe Bush pushed us into war for three main reasons.  One - For revenge on the assasination attempt on his father and to show the world that no one can ignore the wishes of the U.S. ( I call this motive "The Cowboy Motive"  Two -  to gain control of Iraqi oil.  (I call this motive "The Family Business Motive.)  Three -  I think we were too blind for our own liking and needed to establish a stronger intellegence link in the Middle East.  (I call this motive "The President of the Country Club Motive.)  There really is no excuse to go into another country that is not a direct threat to us.  National Security may be important to us, but we don't seem to respect that other countries have needs as well and it is not right for us to just walk over them because they annoy our comfort zone.
Just a Ben update.  I have finally moved in to my new place and set up shop.  I have finally got my washing machine to stop spraying the room by replacing the rubber washers in the hoses and using a shit load of plumbing tape on the threads.  I have finally set up a T.V. with rabbit ears and have been enjoying PBS, CBS, FOX, WB, and a plethora of religious channels.  Maybe enjoying is the wrong word there.  I've been watching PBS the most.   I actually start hating CBS after awhile because I am not a kid or a parent.  I don't think I fit their demographics.  Anyway, as you can tell from my T.V. talk that my life is pretty damn exciting now.  That's all for now.

I spent two good work hours on trying to decide who I like best for Kerry's VP.  Thanks  urlLink Amos  for the  urlLink Ontheissues  link.   I still think that a Kerry/Bayh ticket is probably the most electable, but if I am correct in thinking that we can still win this election by choosing the best person for the VP job, it would be Kerrey.

Sleep has not been good to me lately.  Most of the time, I require at least 7 hours a night to be normal, but I've been going the last 3 and 1/2 weeks with only about 3-4 hours a night.  Not on purpose, but just because I can't seem to sleep.  I can't figure out what it is that keeps me from sleeping.  Here is my list of suspects:(any or all of these may be to blame.)  1. Too much caffeine during the day. 2. Eating too close to when I go to bed. 3. Thinking about various women that I would like to know better. 4. Worried that I won't go to sleep. 5. My stomach stays upset all week from the week-end's drinking. 6. Worried about life direction. 7. My body is just use to 3-4 hours of sleep now. 8. Smoking too close to bedtime. 9. There is something wrong with my brain. 10.I am sleeping. I'm just dreaming that I lie in my bed and stare at the ceiling.    Honorable Mention:  All these damn prison reports I have to read everyday.
Drinking and smoking... Drinking and smoking... Drinking and smoking... I really can't do this anymore. I know it sounds false when a guy with a site called the Drunkenfish says he doesn't want to drink and smoke anymore. I've never made such claims on this site. (I'll have to check the archives on that one) Today I am making a claim and I will hold to it. I am through with Drinking and Smoking. I am simply done. I still want to go to parties and hang out with friends or family at the bar, but I will not personally be drinking or smoking. So there. I think I convinced myself. Anyone else buying this?
The history of seitans origin and different ways to prepare the seitan.   Seitan (say-TAHN) is made from gluten. Gluten is the name of the insoluble protein in wheat, probably most familiar as the stuff that makes bread dough elastic. Known as Seitan in Japan, as kofu in China, and as "wheat meat" and "gluten" here in the U.S., seitan is a low fat, high protein, firm-textured meat substitute. It has been eaten in China, Japan, Korea, Russia and the Middle East for thousands of years. Gluten is often referred to in Chinese restaurants as "Buddha food", because of the claim that it was developed by pacifist, vegetarian Buddhist monks as a meat substitute. It is a food rich in tradition as well as nutrition.   As a protein source, seitan contains about 31 grams of protein per 4 ounce serving (which means it has more plant protein per serving than tofu), provides a modest amount of B vitamins and iron and contains no saturated fat or cholesterol. A 3 1/2 ounce (100 gram) serving contains 118 calories, 18% protein and less than 1% unsaturated fat. The same amount of beef has 207 calories and 32.2% protein and is high in saturated fats. As recent studies have shown, our need for protein is much lower than previously believed and any opportunity to remove saturated fats from our diet would be an excellent improvement.   Another dietary benefit of seitan is its low sodium content, although cooking often adds considerably to this. Most of the commercially prepared seitan contains a considerable amount of sodium (up to 100 mg. per ounce). If you choose to deep-fry the gluten, the fat content will jump from virtually zero to the number of grams in whatever oil is absorbed (at 4.5 grams per teaspoon). Moreover, like grain foods in general, this protein is incomplete and needs to be complemented with other protein sources such as dairy or legumes.   Many vegetarians' first experience with eating gluten is at Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants, where it's called "mock duck", "mock chicken", etc. When it's sold in little tubs at the natural/health food store, it's called Seitan again, probably because marketing studies showed that the word "gluten" lacks consumer appeal. It stands in for meat in many recipes and works so well that some vegetarians prefer to avoid it because the texture is too "meaty." However, for many vegetarians and others who are trying to make the transition to a meatless lifestyle, Wheat Meat" is growing in popularity.   Seitan usually starts out as whole grain wheat or high gluten flour mixed with water to obtain a bread dough consistency. The dough is kneaded vigorously for about 10 minutes, and then is left to rest so the gluten can develop. Next, it is rinsed many times under running water, which removes most of the starch and much of the bran. What is left is a firm, stringy mass of high protein gluten that is then cooked in soy sauce and water with other spices added for flavoring, often including the sea vegetable kombu. When raw gluten (wheat dough with the starch washed away) has been cooked in a broth of shoyu, ginger, and kombu, it's called "seitan".   It is now ready to be used in casseroles, stir-fry, sandwiches, and enchiladas or just about anywhere that you might previously have used meat. It can be oven-braised, baked, cooked in a pressure cooker, or deep-fried. Each version yields a different texture. Oven braising produces a texture similar to the chewy texture derived from simmering. Baking produces a light texture that works well when grinding or grating seitan. Pressure-cooking will produce a softer texture. Fried gluten turns soft and slippery when cooked with a sauce and absorbs flavor well.    - Written by Alyx Sandborg, Copyright 2002 by PageWise, Inc

Hosted by Kim O'Donnel washingtonpost.com Staff Writer Thursday, April 29, 2004; 12:00 PM  Released MAY 5, 2004  A graduate of Peter Kump's New York Cooking School, Kim spends much of her time in front of the stove or with her nose in a cookbook.   The transcript follows.   Editor's Note: Washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions.   ________________________________________________   Kim O'Donnel: Hello out there. It's been a while since our last get-together. For those who are new, this is a monthly (usually) hour devoted to meat-free cooking, eating and shopping, held on the last Thursday on the month. Since we last discussed, I came across a fun piece on Yahoo! about a new term coined for people who consider themselves part-time vegetarians: "flexatarian." I think that would aptly describe my eating habits. Interesting piece because it brings to light that more and more people are eating less and less meat and choosing diversity among their food sources rather than the same ole same ole. So, tell what's happening in your worlds...by the way, my upcoming video series will feature some veggie items -- will keep you posted. Onward...   _______________________   I'm a goin veggie huntin....: Kim!; Two questions: First, are you going to do another farmers market tour anytime soon? Second, what great things should I look for at the farmers market this saturday morning?    Kim O'Donnel: The nice people at Arlington Courthouse have been very patient with me as I've not gotten my act together on setting a date. It'll be sometime in May or June, probably June. Funny you ask about what's at market: my bit on WTOP this morning was all about my finds last weekend. Think green, kids. It's all about the greens -- green garlic, garlic chives, cilantro, parsley, chervil, asparagus, lamb's quarters (tastes like spinach, super easy to cook), baby kale, frisee, baby lettuce...such beauty and so tasty!   _______________________   Frederick, Md.: I'm a strict vegetarian and have always loved the creative aspects of cooking. However, my diet restrictions have prevented me from pursuing any formal culinary training. Can you recommend any culinary programs that are vegetarian-friendly? (My goal is not necessarily to become a full-time chef, but a vegetarian food writer/cookbook author.)   Kim O'Donnel: There is a vegetarian cooking school in New York City that has a good reputation. Name escapes me at the moment; it might be Natural Cookery something something...there are also shorter-term culinary vacations that are veg-friendly. Check out shawguides.com   _______________________   St. Paul, Minn.: My two-year-old is allergic to milk but can eat yogurt; he also drinks a little soy milk. I don't think he gets enough calcium. Any suggestions? And can you tell me how to make a smoothie? After I make one, how long can I leave it in the refrigerator?   Kim O'Donnel: Lentils are loaded with calcium. Spinach and broccoli also good sources...there's soy yogurt out there...don't know if allergy extends to goat's milk, but lots of new brands offering goat's milk yogurt...smoothies: I prefer with yogurt, and to it, I add 1 banana, plus any other fruits on hand, including a kiwi, a handful of berries, some pineapple, a half mango...blend. I don't add ice or juice because I like mine thicker, but you certainly can adjust to your tastes. Doesn't last long at all in fridge; best to drink within one hour.   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim. Just got back from New Orleans and while I made an exception to my vegetarian leanings to try a bite of jambalaya, I'd love to make my own. Any suggestions? I'm thinking smoked tofu, maybe?   Kim O'Donnel: I think smoked tofu is an interesting idea, and you've got meatless sausage links as well as the Gimme Lean brand of tube-like sausage that fries up well...hope you're adding okra!   _______________________   Prince Frederick, Md.: Can anyone recommend a good vegetarian cookbook that doesn't look like it was put together by a bunch of Sherpas in Tibet. Most of what I've seen were printed on course-textured paper, brown ink, rather depressing to say the least. I want to know which grains and beans and dairy can be combined to make favorful, healthy meals without a lot of fat. I still use dairy and eggs -- you don't need to kill a cow or chicken for those things.   I can go for weeks without eating meat; it's not a major portion of my diet. But what really turned me off about meat was reading "Fast Food Nation." It revealed how filthy and dangerous our meat packing plants are, what evils lurk in your meat which can make you very sick, and what underhanded management of the food industry is doing to us. I recommend everyone read it, as well as "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair.   Kim O'Donnel: Prince,  Vegetarian cookbooks have come a LONG way from the days of co-ops and communes...There are so many titles out there you may have trouble deciding. Immediately what comes to mind are titles by Deborah Madison, Jeanne Lemlin and then there's Crescent Dragonwagon's "Passionate Vegetarian", loads of titles by Robin Robertson...and all of them are very contemporary.   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim,   My husband is trying to find out how to make this pasta sauce that is green and creamy, with gorgonzola and walnuts. Any ideas as to what it is?  Thanks a bunch!   Kim O'Donnel: The green is probably coming from either arugula or spinach. This is a fun one to make, pretty easy, too. You can mix some gorgonzola with a touch of cream, stir over heat, gently tho...you could puree the greens, drain out water, REALLY well...mix in with the cheese, add nuts, chopped, and then mix into your pasta...   _______________________   Virginia: Does you have any suggestions for good-quality fake chicken or beef? I am looking for big pieces, not something that is "ground." I have tried a couple of things without much luck. Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Many looking for similar products like the taste of Quorn, which is made from a mycoprotein (fungus similar to mushrooms)...they've got Quorn roasts, and patties and nuggets and all kinds of things...anyone else with fake meat ideas?   _______________________   Anonymous: I have known people who can't drink cow's milk but are just fine with goat milk. They sell it at Whole Foods.   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for chiming in...that's what I was thinking...   _______________________   Silver Spring, Md.: For meatless jambalaya, I'd use tempeh, I like it better than tofu in a tomatoey dish. Some seitan might be good for texture also.   Kim O'Donnel: Ah, bueno. Thanks, Silver!   _______________________   Reston, Va.: I'm sure you have answered this a billion times, but I hope you will humor me anyway... are there any year-round farmer's markets in the area (pref. northern va)?   Kim O'Donnel: Yes, yes, yes!  Arlington Courthouse, on Saturday mornings.  Dupont Circle and Takoma Park, Sunday mornings.    _______________________   Veggie burger: I've been trolling through the archives, but can't find it. Can somebody offer up a good home-made veggie burger recipe? Not lentils, please (ewww...)   Kim O'Donnel: A few months back, there was a slew of ideas over a two-week period. Since then, I made chickpea patties, tinkered with some recipes and came up with my own variation. I did chickpeas and mashed potatoes, with herbs, garlic, onion...but I gotta get you the details. I don't have them here at my desk, but am happy to provide after I look through my papers at home...   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: We like to eat Morning Star Farms "Chik Nuggets" - they also come in patties. My son particularly likes to have this when friends who "hate" veggies are over, 'cause they usually love them and can't believe they ate something NOT chicken.   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for weighing in on this 'meaty' matter, Arlington.   _______________________   East Falls Church, Va.: Hi, Kim!   You mentioned last chat (Tues) that you mash ginger in morter and pestle. I presume you peel it first, but I, too, hate grating ginger and would like to try this option. (for example, do you have to mash more than needed to get enough?).   Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Hey EFC,  Yeah, I cut off what I need, then peel it with a teaspoon, cut into a few smaller pieces and then pound with the m&p. Works really well, and no, you do get what you need.   _______________________   Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.: For your reader who inquired about the vegetarian  cooking school . . . yes, it's called the Natural  Gourmet Cookery School  (www.naturalgourmetschool.com) in New York City.  They also do dinners open to the public on most  Friday evenings. Sounds like a great opportunity to  sample great food from the students.   Kim O'Donnel: Hey, thanks for following up!   _______________________   New York, N.Y.: Kim,   I need fruit help. I feel stuck between seasons--apples and pears on the way out, citrus is blah, but it's too early for summer fruits, right? What should I look for that's going to be tasty, that is, in season or almost in season? I'm 8 months pregnant and trying very hard to be good, when I all really want is to stop at Kripsy Kreme!;   Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: It IS a tough time for fruit. I was just thinking the same thing while in the supermarket this week. Soon come: local strawberries, plus figs. Mangoes are coming in from various parts of the world where they are in season, fyi...   _______________________   Re: Low Fat Veggie Cookbook: Moosewood has a low-fat vegetarian cookbook, and it includes MANY more things than what sherpas would eat. It has its fair share of twigs and berries, but also a lot of grains, beans, tofu, pasta, and cheese variations.   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for reminding me...my Moosewood, with the international focus, is very dog-eared from years of use.   _______________________   For Reston looking for farmers market in NoVa:: The Falls Church farmers mkt at city hall starts this week, on saturday mornings   Kim O'Donnel: Great news, and thanks for helping out a fellow reader.   _______________________   Alexandria, Va.: Hi Kim!   When you mention farmers' markets, you often neglect to mention the Alexandria Farmers' Market, which goes year-round, and is the oldest in the area. It's open from 5:30am (ugh!)to 10:30am every Saturday.   Kim O'Donnel: Very glad that you've reminded me, Alexandria.   _______________________   Virginia: I am so excited, I just have to share. For years, I have been trying to make mango lassis like the ones in Indian restaurants, but the ones I made were never as good. I finally found the secret: rosewater. You only need a couple of drops, but it makes all the difference. Also, the frozen mango chunks from Trader Joe's make lassi-making very easy, and I find the quality to be very good. I have been drinking them every day this week!   Kim O'Donnel: Funny you mention that - was just talking with the woman who's been consulting me on some Indian recipes for video series, and she was saying that very thing...but if you add too much, your lassi can taste like lipstick...thanks for sharing.   _______________________   Silver Spring, Md.: Hi Kim -  I have been eating a wonderful whole grain mixture for breakfast - oat groats, millet, brown rice, seeds, etc... I've been mixing with apple and it's very yummy.   I'm thinking it would also make a great salad, with jicama, zucchini, red peppers and more but don't know how to dress it. Do you have any ideas?   Love your chats - you rock!   Kim O'Donnel: Squeeze of lemon or orange or grapefruit and some olive oil, Silver. Some fresh chopped parsley or cilantro, salt, pepper, garlic, scallions. Sounds nice.   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim, I want to make a tofu and veggie curry...does tofu go with curry seasonings? Also, i'm not great with really spicy stuff, so can you give me a good mild (yet flavorful!) curry recipe to use with this? Would I cook the tofu at all before adding it in? I'm not sure where to start...   Thanks!!   Kim O'Donnel: Do you want to do coconut milk curry? Talk to me.   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim,  White bean bruschetta - I tried to make it  last night but forgot the ingredients - & I  bought the wrong kind of beans. Here's  what I came up with so far - what am I  missing (or how can I vary it)?   tomatoes, onions, lime juice, fresh basil   Kim O'Donnel: The beauty of bruschetta is that you can mess up and no one will ever know...in Italy, bruschetta are among the many "salatini" that are put out on bar counters as snacks,and often they consist of ingredients in the kitchen at that moment. You can vary this any way you want...one fun thing is to toast bread slices and then rub a whole clove of garlic on each slice...don't forget salt. Lemon zest is great. Rosemary is beautiful with white beans...one thing that helps is to keep you mixture fairly dry...   _______________________   Fairfax, Va: Kim,   My wonderful, beautiful, patient wife is a vegetarian, and I'm a happy meat eater. I'd like to make her a special dinner some night, but I'd like to do it on the grill. What can I cook for her that will be flavorful and unique? (And how do I do it)?   Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: You can make her skewers of pineapple, red onion (or pearl onions), bell peppers and squares of tofu. Brush the whole thing with soy sauce, sesame oil, a little honey and sprinkle some cayenne. Serve over rice. You, sir, can have that, after you grilled for your lovely wife, a steak or some fish kebabs...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim,  Speaking of farmer's markets, do you know what is going on with the one that started last year, on Thursdays in Penn Quarter (I think it was on 7th and E maybe?) Is it coming back? Do you know when? It was so nice to be able to do some quick shopping on my way home from the office since the area is bereft of any real supermarkets...  Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Yes, it is. Starting next Thursday, May 6, from 3 to 7.   _______________________   Bethesda, Md.: Hello-  Do you know where one could go to pick strawberries and the like around here? Preferably in MD. THanks   Kim O'Donnel: Weekend section usually does an annual list which I'm betting will come out next month. Anyone with tried and true strawberry picking spots?   _______________________   Rockville, Md.: My favorite Italian restaurant serves veggie ravioli with a killer pistachio cream sauce. In making this at home would you recommend the "plain old salted" bagged variety or using plain nuts instead...   Kim O'Donnel: Plain, unsalted. You got it...   _______________________   Vegetarian Pigs in a Blanket: Does anyone have any ideas for how to make vegetarian pigs in a blanket? I am open to both synthetic meat and more natural options. Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: I'm throwing this out to you guys for thoughts, etc...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hey Kim, A quick question for you- whare are some good (tasty and healthy) snack foods you could reccomend? I'm trying to cut back on sugar, so I'd rather have some sort of veggie and dip as a snack after work instead of a cookie. Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Making your own hummus or white bean spread is very easy, takes about 15 minutes. Can be used for dipping or as a sandwich filler...high protein, no sugar, good fats from olive oil...   _______________________   soy bechamel?: Any reason not to use soy milk in a bechamel sauce? There's a recipe for a killer mushroom lasanga made with a bechamel sauce in the March Cooking Light that I'd like to modify. Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Chemical composition of soy milk is different, but doesn't mean it can't work. I don't know for sure. My copy of "Dairy-Free Cooking" offers some "cream sauce" ideas...so why not??   _______________________   Vege in Fairfax, Va.: To the question about Paneer from the What's cooking chat. One can drain it in Cheese cloth and tea sieve to hold the contents in. Keep in a cold place overnite. Remember to close the top of the sieve so that other odors from other products dont mix in.  Actually Mango lassi is not very common in India. Lassi is usually salty. I just buy low fat butter milk and make a spice mixture of roasted cumin, curry leaves, rock salt and white pepper(all ground together) and beat the lassi until frothy. Yummy  Try cardamon in your Mango lassi for the extra zing!   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks, Fairfax...great tidbits...I'm only just learning about buttermilk for lassis...   _______________________   St. Louis, Mo.: Another cookbook suggestion: I started out veggie with the "Horn of the Moon" cookbook by Ginny Callan. Many yummy recipes, all vegetarian. A follow-up book, "Beyond the Moon," includes more recipes with an international/fusion twist (Carribean variations, tempeh burritos, etc.) Worth a look.   Kim O'Donnel: Not familiar with this one, St. Lou. Thanks for the tidbit...   _______________________   Suitland, Md.: Does anyone know of a good Soy Cheese brand? Something that actually tastes like cheese? I am looking for a block that I can grate.   Thanks!!   Kim O'Donnel: Who knows of soy cheese that can be grated???   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim!; I have some fresh green beans and want to do something spicy with them, but without a trip to the store. I have oil, soy sauce, dried red crushed pepper, and fresh garlic. I was thinking of stirring them up in a pan, but would it be better to blanch them first? Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: Blanching them does help bring them along, Washington, even if you only do it for a minute or so...not a bad idea....   _______________________   Bethesda, Md.: Hello Kim-  I have an eggplant question for you. I generally hate eggplant (hate the texture) but there is one way that I really, really love it. I know it is simple but can't figure it out. I usually have it as antipasto in Italian restaurants or when I was in Italy. It is basically sliced eggplant and balsamic vinigar. I don't know if it is cooked and then cooled to room temp or simply marinated. Can you help me? Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Eggplant is one of those things that needs to be cooked, Bethesda. Was it in cubes, slices, all mushed up? Do tell...   _______________________   Boston, Mass.: Hi Kim,   What can I do with Broccoli besides steam it?  Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: I like roasting it, at 500 degrees. But first, roll florets in a mix of chopped ginger, olvie oil, garlic, paprika, salt, black pepper, stuff like that. It's a great treat!   _______________________   Indian Head, Md.: Hi Kim! My new favorite meal: vegetarian tacos made with tempeh and browned onions. I am using a boxed mix, but would like suggestions on making the taco seasoning from scratch.   They are delicious with veggie cheese, tomatoes and julienned spinach on top!   J   Kim O'Donnel: Let's see...I'd do cayenne, black pepper, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, cloves (a dash only!), maybe even some coriander...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: My special someone has a birthday coming up and I wanted to cook something specatular and vegetarian for them. Do you have any cookbooks or sources or recipes in mind that I could try and use?   Kim O'Donnel: Spectacular and vegetarian...I'm thinking of a curry. I've got an interesting idea for a Thai-style tofu curry with pineapples and potatoes, but I think cauliflower, green beans would also go beatifully...let me know if this is of interest...   _______________________   Oxford, Miss: I'm a vegetarian and one of my favorite meals is rice and beans, but I'm getting bored with my recipe. Do you have any suggestions for how to liven up this old classic?   Kim O'Donnel: Do you make a sofrito for your r& b? You know, a mixture of chopped onions, green peppers, garlic and some herbs...like a little thyme or oregano...I'd also add a chopped fresh chile...   _______________________   Reston, Va.: Good morning Kim. Still struggling with the white sweet potatos. Any ideas?   Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Not very often that we see white sweet potatoes...I'd roast them, mix with lime, cilantro and sesame oil after cooking...or do some garlic and chiles, plus a little oil...fresh parsley is also nice, a little lemon zest...   _______________________   Herndon, Va.: Oh joy - grilling time is upon us... but my  marinate recall has lapsed  please advise with some great basics for  marinating - I'm specifically thinking of the  little mushrooms and zucchini I bought  yesterday for BBQ skewers, but a good  marinate could work on most foods...   also, any hints on grilling veg on  skewers?  thanks in advance   Kim O'Donnel: Salt really well. Use a brush. Olive oil, although simple, is a good standby...fresh sprigs of herbs are great too...indirect heat...pieces should all be the same size...   _______________________   Reston, VA: Hooray for the mention of the Alexandria farmers'  market. My great-grandfather sold there every  Saturday morning and my great-aunt and my dad  tell fabulous stories about getting up -really- early  to go to market. There are also lots of stories about  my dad stealing strawberries out of the baskets that  were packed on Friday...   Kim O'Donnel: Nice story, Reston. Thanks for the memories...   _______________________   Re: strawberry picking: Butler's Orchard, in Germantown (MD). You can call their phone line to find out what's available when.   Kim O'Donnel: Excellent!   _______________________   Laurel, MD: Chiming in:   Rice and beans: I've been planning a reverse black beans  and white rice using white beans and some of the black  rice, seasoned with a South-east Asian theme.   Kim O'Donnel: Ooh...I like that...   _______________________   Dallas, Texas - Arugala: Hi Kim.  Wanted to share a great sauce recipe. I sauteed fresh asparagus spears in some water (could use wine) and lemon juice, with salt and pepper. Then added a can of crushed tomatoes, and a little bit of sugar, garlic, and onions. Let it all cook together till the sauce thickens. I served it with brown rice, but it could be easily served with pasta. At the end, add fresh arugala - it adds incredible zip to the recipe. Very healthy and delicious. And with all the flavors, you won't miss the meat.   ~Chef in training   Kim O'Donnel: Very nice indeed, Dallas. Keep sending reports of your experiments!   _______________________   Washington, DC: This may sound a little strange, but what exactly are white beans? I.E. does the can say "White Beans" are is it like white fish and any number of varities could apply? Thanks for the insight.   Kim O'Donnel: White beans actually refer to only a few kinds: cannellini (which are really white kidney beans) and Great Northern beans. They are interchangeable.   _______________________   Adams Morgan: How does one make a white bean spread?   Kim O'Donnel: A can of drained white beans. Whiz in a food processor. Olive oil, garlic, chopped fresh rosemary, cayenne, salt. Taste. Lemon zest is nice, too. Taste. Add more seasoning if needed. Taste for smoothness, too. You're good to go.   _______________________   Arlington, VA: Hi,   I hope you can help me. I have a 7 year old who used to eat all kinds of vegitables. Ever since she started school, she stopped eating vegitables. The only vegitable she'll eat are corn on the cob or if I grind up veggies inside dumplings. I tried serving veggies with gravy/salt/cheese and she acts like she's in Fear Factor eating worms. I think it's a texture thing. Do you have any suggestions?   Kim O'Donnel: Take her to the farm market this weekend. Introduce her to a farmer. Let her pick out something that the two of you can make together. Obviously she likes veggies if she was eating them before; making the preparation fun could open her eyes. Let me know how it goes...   _______________________   Kim O'Donnel: Out of time, folks. Thanks for all the good stuff. Take good care, eat well, and get out there to your neighborhood farm market! The air is now fresh, the new crops are for the taking! Promise to be back for end of May, and in meatime, join me for the regular Tuesday free for all..Best to you.   _______________________    © 2004 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive
By JESSICA RAE PATTON, May 7 2004  I recently spent the weekend in Chicago, the city of encased meat. Just about any poor critter that can be ground and stuffed in a swag of intestine, then boiled or grilled and served in a bun, can be bought for a couple bucks every few blocks at one of the ubiquitous hot dog stands there.  At Hot Doug's, for example, aside from the traditional pork and beef wieners there were chicken, pheasant, wild boar and lamb tube steaks.  But there were also rumors of a veggie dog, which is how my animal-munching friend Emily lured me to this popular bratwurst bistro. Because the fact is, although I'm a vegan, I'm a fool for fake meat. Or anything, really, that can serve as a vehicle for condiments and be eaten alongside French fries, the more lowbrow the atmosphere the better--diners, burger shacks, carnival snack stands. These food venues usually fall short in the fried-faux-meat category, as you might imagine. But I guess because Chicago's a city teeming with working-class hipsters--two-fisted liberals, as Studs Terkel refers to them--folks whose proletariat taste buds sometimes clash with their compassionate eating ethics, the local sausage slingers make concessions with their concessions. I, for one, thank Doug and his colleagues for this. That was one damn good dog. Char-grilled, with onions, a pickle spear, some neon relish, tomato slices and yellow mustard, all overflowing a squishy roll.  I returned home with an unabatable hankering for a faux dog with all the fixings, donned the first shorts of the season and set out with the crazy notion that I might be able to score a veggie dog at one of our local hot dog haunts. I dragged my boyfriend, Art, along to taste-test the real ones.  I f you want a guaranteed hostile reaction, head for the greasiest of greasy spoons and suggest they add a veggie dog to the menu. At the original Swanky Frank's, a worn-down wiener shack overlooking a scenic I-95 on-ramp, the owner, Bob, snorted, "That would be sacrilegious."  "But I was in Chicago, and--"  "This isn't Chicago, is it?" He said and walked away. Was he really pissed off, or just a grouchy guy in general? Maybe I was naïve to the subversive nature of soy protein. And here I just wanted one more place to spend my money on some good, cheap grub.  I sat on a rickety stool and ordered French fries and blathered on about writing a food review. The fry cook, who looked like Billy Bob Thornton playing a surly fry cook, shook his head in disgust and muttered something about how you can't write a food review if all you eat is French fries. These guys were in their 30s, early 40s tops, but they had the grumpy old geezer thing down. Their disdain was as thick as the mystery oil they were deep-frying--yup, deep-frying--the dogs in.  In all fairness, our server at the swankier of the Swankies, in Westport, was super-friendly. (Let's consider the first location Skanky Frank's, as to not confuse the two.) She smiled and everything. The place also looked like it had been intimate with both a paintbrush and a sponge in recent memory. Art highly approved of the deep-fried technique. "It makes the texture crackly, not snappy."  "Snappy?"  "Yeah, some hot dogs are snappy. The skin won't give right away when you bite it, then it snaps."  He also liked that the raw onions were self-serve. For the sake of quality assurance he ordered the same dog toppings at every stop: bacon, ketchup, onions. "The bacon's under the dog, where it should be," he noted.  The French fries were great: thin-cut, some skin left on for that dirty taste, super-crisp but not crisped through. We liked that our order was wrapped up in an old-timey cardboard box.  Dog: $2.90, Fries: $2.25   • • •    Rawley's Drive-In 1886 Post Rd., Fairfield, 259-9023  Rawleys' décor makes Skanky Frank's look positively posh. The wood paneling interior has decades of initials, names and declarations of love scratched into its surface, like a summer camp cabin. Two high-school-age boys flew around the kitchen putting orders together.  "So. Would you ever consider carrying a veggie dog, you think?"  "NO WAY!" The one working the grill yelled. "People freak out if we change anything here. We had to repair those walls," he gestured to two white walls behind him, "to meet health codes, and people flipped out. A veggie dog? They'd KILL us!"  They got every single thing about our order wrong--handed us someone else's food, gave Art the wrong drink, rang the order up incorrectly, made it "for here" instead of "to go." The more flustered they got, the more they messed up. I didn't mind a bit. It somehow went with the summer camp vibe, and I thought it was probably a fluke. They were extremely apologetic. "It was SO busy a minute ago, we were SLAMMED," the one at the cash register explained.  The word "Poop" was engraved in huge letters right below the counter.  The cook pulled Art's dog from the fry basket, split it and threw it on the grill. "It's deep-fried and grilled?" I asked, because I couldn't believe it. It was like a heart attack on a bun.  After a couple investigative bites, Art reported that he actually preferred Swanky Frank's single dose of grease, though the Rawley's dog also passed the crackly texture test, the bun was fresh and well-toasted and there was a generous amount of bacon draped over the dog.  I was still trying to interpret "snappy." "Is it that feeling of breaking the seal with your teeth?" I asked.  "Exactly," he said.  "I like that," I said.  "That's the thing. It's so hard to judge hot dogs, because they're such a historical food in a person's life." He gestured philosophically with his dog. "People are fanatical about these. This is the perfect hot dog if it's what you grew up with."  No one could get nostalgic about the fries, however, which were of the frozen, crinkle-cut variety, mealy and barely browned.  Dog: $2.40, Fries: $1.90   • • •    Super Duper Weenie 306 Black Rock Turnpike,Fairfield, 334-DOGS  I admit I was biased in favor of Super Duper Weenie to begin with for its name. And if I had to eat off any of the linoleum-checked floors, this would be the one. By now I was resigned that there were no take-out veggie dogs in my near future... when I spotted its cousin on the menu.  "How long have you carried veggie burgers for?" I asked the cashier, who turned out to be one of the owners, Lorin.  "Since we opened," he said.  "But you don't have a veggie dog?"  "Veggie dog? I can't say we've ever considered it." He appeared to actually be contemplating the concept.  "Would you consider it?"  "I don't think they'd sell."  "Do the veggie burgers sell?"  "Yeah."  "So why wouldn't a veggie dog?"  "We're a greasy hot dog place."  "You could just try it out."  "We have tuna..."  "Please?"  "I'll think about it. We've honestly never thought of it before."  Art surveyed his super duper dog. Plentiful onions, two fat strips of bacon. But I could tell his assessment by the face he made when biting down. Snappy. He liked the flavor of the meat, if not the texture, but Swanky Frank's was his personal overall favorite dog of the day, no question.  We agreed the fries were stellar--the best of the bunch by far. Lots of skin, whittled-thin shapes, perfectly crisp with downy insides. Lorin gave the batch a generous shake of pepper as well as salt. Pepper on French fries! Kind of nouveau cuisine for a former hot dog truck, don't you think? I just know an animal-free frank is next...  Dog: $2.70 Fries: $2.25  Copyright © 2004, Fairfield County Weekly
Here is a little introduction to a few of them     Soya : Soya is a good source of protein and low fat. Can be used to produce milk, dairy replacements products, as well as to replace the texture and bulk of meat, usually in the form of textured vegetable protein. Is usually the basis for many meat substitutes.     Tofu  : Manufactured by a process similar to cheese making, but from soya milk. Very good source of protein, calcium and low fat.  Able to take on flavours well — great for marinating. Can be used for stir–fries, kebabs, salads and just about anything savoury. Tofu also is available in a silken form which is used for desserts, sauces or flans.     Quorn : Not made from soya but is a mycoprotein. Made from the fermentation of a fungus, mixed with egg white. Usually found as chunks, mince, fillets, burgers or sausages.
Outside North Ridge Hospital, the one that I know all the shortcuts to, I sit waiting for Triple A after hand holding in room 426 this time.  My grandmother is in again for rehydration. This time it's been 8 days. Today was by far the hardest. I decided to reach across and hold her hand bruised, swollen, arthritis with gout, not really a hand anymore.  Years of sewing trusses, hunched over, and for low pay.  I suspect she won't be around much longer. I think she has decided to let go. After all, there is nothing left here for her but more pain and the missing husband of 53 years, now dead 13 months.  The past 6 have been reasonable considering her coherence is so limited but today she was there. I saw in her eyes the same Grandmother who played games with me all summer long, put on plays, treated me like sugar on top of strawberries and now, me, child of 30 at her bedside; shriveled old woman the years were not kind to, wanting death knowing too full well now in my reaching out was saying to her from all of us for the first time the last time, you are forgiven.
Carnival   Oh, but to feel this good, this flushed face, your voice,  breathe, breathe.  I am hyperventalating. I am electrified; blowing up like a balloon  and rising to the top of the tent past tight-rope walkers.  I rise up and through,  The canvas melts away to let me pass, and it's all stars and sliver moon,  up, up, up.
Accidental Rhyme   It comes out like this, running water against porcelain, into a glass, or bottle,  captured for espresso, mixed into soup, taken with vitamins, or with a $20 placebo when I am lucky.  It quenches my thirst or leaves me bloated. When I jump up and down, I can hear it always inside me sloshing around.
Six Before Breakfast   Memories of wanting more and I left you the gift  of my sigh to ponder, getting the last word in before my power cut off,  denying all but me the right to caffeine.  Eight hours later, the work day spent, my smile shows no sign of setting into the horizon.  I wonder  will I wake to your words in the morning.
5:30 Wake Up Call   The dream ended abruptly, your voice on the line  and I couldn't roll over and turn it off, knowing time is too short to make decisions.  You tell me what love is;  unbroken speech, poetry before sun up and you tell me what love is;  again.  I listen, but there is more in my silence.  I listen, my inner abacus clicking and clacking against and over the crackling static that does not come from a clear connection;  and you tell me what I am afraid of;  again.  I have no time for these  parlor games;  cheap satoris leaving others open mouthed and astonished,  but not me.  I dealt those same cards eight and half years ago, my ego fed by those same eyes, that same hunger for confirmation seldom remembered the next day, and so the repetition continues.  You tell me what I want because you are afraid to hear the words from my lips and in an instant crack your mirror  or reflect something you will not remember tomorrow.
Kundalini Rizing   I am cross legged, spine growing, root to the ground; pushing it all towards the center and breathing deep light from below, from above, meets in the heart chakra up to the blue light shining,  lotus flower opening, growing, tickles like static electricity like the salt pepper atomic tv glow, chanelled, funneled up like a tube, suction, highcracking of stretching, straight then swaying  here, now.
Hello   Wanting to call you is pushing a hole right through, band-aid ripped from skin leaving a ring around the wound;  and the dancing visions, and the considerations, weighing, measuring,  and the wondering of how you would answer and would I get to read you this.
Margaret's Memorial   330 miles for the  privilege of holding my  Grandmother's hand  in the backseat as we drove  to the memorial service for her last  living friend.
RE: Alan   2:30 in the morning and my eyes aren't even  heavy yet;  your voice echoes in this room and from the cell phone;  poems read, traded; words swapped, meaning shared;  and I could be anyone.  Daniel says, "It sounds like you want to run off and join the circus."  I say I am already there.
Stolen Playgrounds   Tiger Woods' homeland stretches out across my field of vision.  I tell the woman to my right that 33% of all the water in Jacksonville must go to feed these lawns; a number pulled out of my ass, but possibly true.  Golfers spot the landscape like cat shit in litter.  I am thinking of the house off Stockton where I spent yesterday, crackheads bumming my clove cigarettes.  I am thinking of the neighborhood I wasn't supposed to walk in after dark and the kids I never saw playing outside.  The wind is blowing and inside the meeting space, people vend their wares to investment bankers and 5th hole wives.  I stub out my smoke and steal a pack of matches from the shiny, clean ashtray.
Out of Town Suit   Waiting for the others to join me at the meeting, I look over my shoulder, suspicious as I type  poetry, in my corporate suit and coffee at hand.  Later, the attendees arrive; two sets of eyes looking for leadership and direction, and all I want to do is get this down on paper,  barely able to contain my need to explain.  There are handouts and brochures scattered about, and nobody knows what's going on at this account.  I am watching them both for inspiration, the way he draws a wobbly arrow in his daytimer, or the laugh-hairflip combo from the woman across my way, beautiful and lost at 23.  I am taking control, and setting expectations.  I am the senior member at the table with no time for distractions.  Moments later, cell phones ring and the meeting is adjourned.  I open back up my laptop and type this.
Reverie   I'm not remembering my dreams just yet.   images of me at the shore taking off my necklace and holding it in the water   The morning wake up call and workout you see, it's all just so hectic.  My favorite thought at the beginning, "I'm walking amongst them," turns, and even I sour.  Still, I'm not quite dreaming, not even for three sustained days.  Sometimes I don't mind the drive.
Sunday   I let Sunday slide down the back of my neck, without, a peep ing Tom at you.  I let Sunday scatter me like marbles, fill my glass with ice, and teach me how  to edit.
Today's Content   There are enough words in what we(I) didn't say today, to fill up the page and get a car wash for free.  I absorbed you like a sponge, a bystander, the auctioneer, going, going...  but what could I offer you  in return, my body of work a messy string of cables and wires connecting everybody but me;  my body of work, a folder of pictures, from when I still dreamed of silver towers, the turbo elevator, and  eating at the company cafeteria like it was some kind of privlege.   You have to believe in something.   I was traded like a basketball star. I was sold to the highest bidder. I was pimped out to hunchbacks lapping the keys and told to repeat myself again and again.  I have told nobody the entire story and only you would understand when I say  that at least alcohol  was more honest.
Skort   When I was younger, it was my "whore heels," as Daniel was fond of saying.  Tight and black with thick wooden heels, the shoes and me, were captured on film,  only 22 years young.  Older now, I rise in my skort,  small and beige, $5.00 off the sale rack at Macy's,  and I am as strong as I was the lost night in Weston,  singing along with the radio on my way to get smokes.
Sol   Named for the sun, his son, with curly blonde smile, brings you another book to read.  It may have been past his bedtime but who could put out that light.  Your voice changes it's pitch and you begin.  I watch you out of the corner of my eye, vaguely listening to the directions away from here.
Return to Jacksonville   One month past and I am back in my room,  30 days different, and even the faces swapped.  I am learning my place in this vast ness; one trip at a time,  financed by the will to please.  If you need specifics, get your own coloring book.
Driver, Not Passenger    Overcome while driving, I call myself to leave a poem on my voice mail.  Calling in later to listen and take dictation, I realize I can't hear a damn thing but the open window,  now just a memory alongside road side stands, boiled peanuts, and a sign for the state prison,  saying to myself for the first time that forever  is just a word.
Aria   What could I show you  to prove nothing to myself.  I don't even have the right to stand and speak.  I haven't even earned my discontent.  I don't even know my own name.  I curl in comfort,  held in the crook of an arm,  while I throw my words off the balcony;  not even catching a glimpse.
The Romance of Words   If only  our ownly responsibility was to just be real;  cream color petals, pink at the edge;  the stars in a ripple of water;  grass underfoot, soft, and warm ground underneath;  an owl on the telephone pole;  the ladies that nod and smile on the morning walk;  coffee at ten  o'clock pm;  and a phone call with an old friend.
Florida Summer Down Pour   Caught out in the rain on our walk to the Banyan tree,  we ran back to the house,  laughing too hard, to stop.
Polished Rock   Still, the copper reflects serene, and imperturbable.  There is a certainty,  or hope,  some call it faith; dependence.

Corporate Poet   No inc.ling of a chance.
In Due Time   Fantasies of writing again push me to discuss the option.  My life coach tells me this is valueless,  who benefits from a poet anyway,  a few friends and maybe family who reads it and says,  "Oh, this is good" or "Interesting, hmm" or maybe says nothing at all.  You can't make money he reminds, and so then there is a lot of suffering.   his monthly check suffering too   And so I ask is a poet that self-indulgent and are they as bad as Matt Groening says in Life in Hell?  Almost mime status?  Fuck it. I have something to say. I'm not writing for you anyway. It comes because it comes  and if I don't let it out, I have no way of  remembering who I am;  and if I don't let it out, I grow ever inward, silent, shamed.  Far better to committ to three pages a day, and learn about myself by reading.  In due time, more will come.
Personal Ad   A stab at normalacy, I wandered to the  Personals web site for just a look;  decided to post.  Two days later, tripping on in, came my first response,  and I am reminded that I am not alone.
In Control   When I get there, will I have to  climb over your expectations to  get in?  You,  always on the look  out for true love or  the next best thing.  Maybe I'm the latter, or ladder, whose rungs you have yet to climb.  Maybe I'm the light you left on by mistake.  It's enough for me now to be humble.  It keeps me in control.
Nicotine is a Bitch Goddess   Half-crazed I plunder my home in search of a lighter;  settle on the stove.  I am smoking inside again. It's all those damn hotel stays, smoking room, king sized bed, and me alone, wretched, pathetic, covers pulled awry and feet hanging out,  thinking about bed fires.  Nicotine is a bitch goddess.  Ok, so it's true. I did start smoking to look cool; 15 and insecure, knowing I was different; wanting it to show more.  I laid down at her alter and bought my first pack of Dorals.  16 years later, I singe eyelashes over Basic menthol lights.  What is it about menthols anyway? Nobody ever wants to bum.  I would have been cooler getting Marlboro reds and packing them down;  tap, tap, tap.
Half-Assed Artist   When I hand over the drawing or poem, it's the same look;  betrayal,  expectation of genius and I give them only this.
My Real Job   It is frustrating, this waiting, this wondering about what exactly it is that I am supposed to be doing here  on this earth, in this house, with this life.  Sometimes, I cramp with shoulds;  the inside voices, huddled together, scheming over plans written in the past.  Sometimes, I burn with maybes;  lofty ideas about what a better person I might become.  I am seldom content with  the moment , unless in silence,  in meditation,  in contemplation and recognition that it is all I have.
When the Moment Strikes   Suddenly you are lifted from the fog,  and all around and inside  is now.  Almost without warning, the picture sharpens;  and even name badges carry hidden meaning.  The words that come out are flushed with heart beat;  some truth to utter,  practicing for the real job that has yet to come;  but sits so close now on the edge of the river,  dangling its toes in the water.
Every Poem Has Two Halves   Every poem  has  two halves.  The first half is pulled.  The second is pushed.  It is giving  and taking, needing  and having.  Letters form in head, letters form on  page.  In the in between, there is typing.
Powered Off   After the meeting we were allowed to return to our cells to prepare for the   group dinner.   The nylon shackles cut for only an instant, then it's back to the lock up.
Correcting Each Other   On the second call it seemed clear enough, that a presence hung over us;   heavy memory   and we began to correct each other.  You spoke of stacks of poetry, 40,000 pages strong.  a nd I know just how strong   "Prolific," I said. "Committed," you countered.   Understood, my friend.   Later on, you were recalling one incident or another. You called me "forgiving."  "Accepting, I reminded.   Understood again, my friend.   It took the charts to bring out the rest.
Some Goddess   You said that, "I inspire you."  And I gushed, girly, giggly, as expected by law;  a law that states a woman could hope for nothing better  but to be muse for some man.  Listen, hon. Epiphanies are not for barter. I offer you nothing in trade.  You chose your muse long ago  (and it comes in a can.)   Don't misunderstand me. I judge no one.  You chose your muse before I was even born;  and  perhaps a lesson for me  is to get off my ass and choose my own;  having learned in the end that love and working for the man ain't gonna cut it.  I have nothing to say, pissed again that the last milepost was just another damn cliche.
Asking For Stories   Words pool along the base and cling to the wick for a moment before letting go.  I watch them slide.  My thoughts are no longer my own. I am reaching for a pen. I am looking for some paper.  I am trying to catch the drips that have eluded me for six years;  the background conversations, the inner dialogue that kept me company on the turnpike but would not stain the page.  I am staring into the flame now, noticing the colors and shadows on the wall,  finger families looking up with wide eyes and asking for stories again.
In the Moments of Rediscovery   In the moments of rediscovery, there is a hesitation;  sweeter than chocolate; richer, deeper, brown;  where possibilities hold themselves in shimmering waves of infinite choice.  You tell me, "I inspire you."  The seas part.
Dopey, Sleepy, Bashful, Happy, Sneezy, Grumpy, and Doc   Which one of the seven did she miss the most,  carry with her to the  other side, or leave behind completely.  After all, you never hear about  what happened after  she married the prince;  the struggle to produce a male heir;  the day when her cheeks became a little  less rosy;  or when the bluebird finally  died.  Who would have told her to leave the laying of golden eggs to the goose?   roasted and splayed on the table, stuffing dribbling out of body cavities  when the eggs stopped coming   What magic mirror had the ovaries to tell her that everything she knew was a fairy tale?  And that that the rescue part   happily ever after   was something  she could have done herself in the end?
Survival Instinct   Mirrors crack, smashed to pieces, shards falling easily,  reflecting a face still used to control, eyes snapping up love  like a paper fan.  Someone is sad. Someone is unsure.  The fit is just not there yet.  There are many layers to digest  and unfold into words.  There are worlds waiting exploration, colors and lights and music, gumball bliss, graffiti sunsets, and the answer  we've all been waiting for, waving  from the next balcony over.
Who Art In Heaven   Hungry to believe that I was the one that asked the moon for forgiveness,  the story is repeated, perhaps for the third time.  I can't be sure,  could be more.  And this I say  to tell you a reason for this  touch deprived angst.  Exuses and reminders, a no win situation or  escape.  Let the dead bury their dead. Release the burdens of your soul. They do not belong to you. They do not control you  Answer it truthfully, here and now.  There is no heavenly father and the one that shows up is years too late,  having forgotten the purpose of his labors, and no rest on the seventh day.
Lessons   The unknown is never known; just remembered.
Thunder   And so it goes on for those blessed enough with a healthy past no clean break,   clean continuation   Squeeky morality. Cheeky morality for popes in hats and nuns in wigs,  The scent riding in on the air is warm, real, arms so big they could fold up the sun; clouds, even airplanes held for a moment in the seconds passing by too fast on a rainy afternoon surprise.
Fort Lauderdale   Not ready to go back just yet; the stillness,  outside cool air; a smoke on the patio; the cats asleep peaceful vibe.  Dreaming of my Virgo man, who has not yet shown himself to me.  Maybe he is waiting inside a coffeehouse books on table, notepad caputuring the spill;  or traveling the world, taking notes.  The breeze through the window, South Florida autumn, brings the first clear air of seasons through my screen.  Soft cloth to the outside glass, let the sun shine warm this room.  Curtains back, parrots in the sky, another cafe con leche, por favor.
The One That Stayed   Soft, her face against my face, cheeks touching,  smile, in her sounds, she is stretched, never changed, given without condition,  curling her body against my own as we drift to sleep.
Precipice   At the edge on the lion's back,  a glass of water shattered against the tile floor,  clouds open up, reveal the sun,  a paper envelope, greased with  tin, the rust stain,  hair collecting in the corners,  and you are still gone.
An Amazing Ten Minutes   heavy hung every second longer than day wider than sleep  waiting  unfold inside out  caught  spun into gold  spun into God meaning the cosmos this universe  This Week's Homework: "To be without attachment and without avoidance."
Maestro   Stronger, your words as though in a flash;  all that you have been, suddenly brilliant, focused, honest, hiding nothing.  Each word, heart beating, pulsing at the lines, spilling, eyes closed, tingling inner,  breathing slower, harder, with each line stanza grouped together; each more powerful than  my last, combining in elements, lining up for the last word;  shot into nothingness, never waiting to stop spinning.
Fortissimo   Sleep beckons, but your words read to me, for me, peal like bells in memory  and I wonder, prone to the condition, curious, demanding,  what will this do to your style;  already changed forever like me.  I do not think or suppose, I am beyond that now, knowing there is no always but now.  Merge and create.  The colors begin to blur, oils mixed in thick haste to cover the pale absence with light.  Chords are stuck, the first time harmony, not even trying, aspiring, and your opus unfolding as I bloom.
FLASH OF REASSURANCE   In an instant, sparklers, the sizzling popping tips, smoking into the July moon.  Fairy tales and unknown possibilities, the penny in the fountain, the divine reaches into nothingness, and a moment's peace.
DETACHMENT   My mother was right. The bone isn't stronger at the place of the break.  I remember this as I listen for the sound of your car turning back.  I have been listening for for 13 years  and you never come.  This time is no different. Your goodbye leaves me  scattered pieces this heart I mended, I tended so carefully these past four months with papers signed.  And tears come like air and sobs are hard like the sprinter's gasp and I find no peace, no deep waters under this shaken surface.  So alone, and you refuse my love again and again.  I know you don't love me. I felt it for six years, the unsurmountable task of communication.  We could find no network that could bring us together, no cables long enough or strong enough to channel the feelings.  And again and again I wait to hear what you can not say.  Maybe you think in your silence you do not hurt my feelings  as much as if I were to hear the truth.  Why is it like this between us?  You are the only man  whose love I have ever  wanted to have.  Time means nothing if it can still hurt just as much now.
THE FIRST COME IS FIRST SERVED   Why argue when you can persuade, I asked you last night.  The word sashayed  along my tongue,  and I am a snake of influence,  slither and glide, convince and  encourage.  Harmless to most, I carry no poison. I delight in commiseration.  My condolences are no sin.  Even scandal can light the way at times  when dark  is bright.
NO SMOKING SIGNS   Five days nicotine free and this hypnosis cure is crueler than patches.  The fire still burns in me, endorphins knowing no rush, and every cell and pore rages at Otis Redding, singing loud and expressive into this waning Wednesday's self-induced insomnia.  The voice repeats in my head and on the audio tape I listen to at night, "Is it good for me?" "Is it worth the price?"  Breathe deep, count down from 11 to 7.  "I am relaxed." "I am calm." "I am in control."  If I was going to reprogam my mind, for the moment that cravings come, I should have asked for orgasm or side splitting laughter instead.  Note to myself: Think bigger next time.
THE SEEKER   She begins from the top of the skyscraper, a pageless freedom knowing only the path down.  Delicious, fingers type, controlling the speed of descent, a rapture, while God is sought  in guarded temples with the Guru, among bacon eating Buddhists saying Om, with the Universalists teaching of prey and predator, and Christians lighting candles to remember.  She is still searching; books at her side are titled "Awareness" or "Transformation" and she scolds herself for not remembering her breath.  She has centered herself between the extremes for now and January is cold.  A waning gibbous moon streaks the green outside like frost  and meditation  is found in the details.
THE LAST WORD   Even as I reach my door, the drama of you continues; train whistle blow outside my window; and I cried out as we raced to catch the 5:40.  "Why does this have to be so dramatic?" and he said,  "Heather, you wouldn't have it any other way."  Train whistle blows a last time, your meaning as you said goodbye, and I choosing myself at last over you.  What healing forms to take the place?  What warm bath of peace, a little gentle place to put the grief.  Back in my box, the hum of the computer, planes overhead dancing, low light, flannel against skin,  breathing again.  I will not be latched in any man's cage. There is no combination to my love or lock to cut off.  I guard and protect my palace with curiosity, having learned the  art of questioning the witness, vicarious observation,  eating the emotions, dipping my bread and licking my fingers clean.  There is such a thing as too close and easy to spot amindst the blackness of eyelid curtains drawn.  Ignite into flame, sparks of wheels braking and every inside awakening.  This is the one I write for you inside my shallow cave of doubt and webs extending time across my space and death at every doorframe.  Damn you, the water that drowns itself, the air that suffocates, the fire leaving ash.  This earth can not bear these burdens nor count the weight of boxes shackled to ankles because you were afraid.  Step up and demand your rightful place. Empty the barrels of regret and shame. Throw the has been into the wind.  You have never been who you are right now.  And if I stamp my feet, and if I scream, then maybe you will leave me alone,  where I want to be, stepping aside.  And you will leave me Sorry China and all your prophesies fulfilled at last.  And I will tell my story into nothingness and remember nothing.  I will gesso over the canvas, press the delete button, and move on,  because that is what I do well.  And if I think it hurts for just a moment, I will blame the moon.  And if you think truth is known when it is named, you are missing the picture.  There is no truth, just images from electrons that flash and burn oblivion soup.
THE REVIEW(S) IS/ARE IN   The words are out in print for comment or not, and the judgement is not guilty  for now.  Decision hangs steady for three days running with little deviation in the story line.  Simple fool to be nothing better than or just something overlooked again.  The wonder of it all and the knowing is like a path.  I stopped on the walk, dropped to my knees and counted, curled like a fist, waiting for the moment past passed.
DISILLUSION MEANT   The moon plays tricks on my peace of mind and I am happily surprised by Pisces Balsamic curl of light.  Surprise is always happy.  Intentional change may present a few road blocks.  Tested and teased, I left my worries on the Bahamas  breeze, the sidewalk balcony outside my room with the mini golf view, and the buffet extravaganza.  The time to leave signals, a flash of lightening and the thunder is a smile.  Nine years passed without the pantyhose battle once brought into the open.  I wore flats and rose colored glasses in defiance of no one but myself in the end.  My reasons have changed but my soul has remained strong.  I have finally found the path I have been walking on all along.
WHEN YOU LEARNED OF MY NAME   10 years ago was me to this place and nothing mattered much but that I could drink and the liquor store so close to my house and Food Lion for beer.  Still I wrote with feriocious intensity; love lost and forlorn of fantasies never formed.  And memories too; the drunken pounding of fingers to the keyboard on my new color screen computer.  I can remember sending you the poems though I can't remember which ones they were or what you might have known when you learned of my name.  I was anybody else at the time and you didn't know about all of the wine or how I came to men or who was why I am.  And I didn't know you were someone real housed in a castle of empties casting your net onto the page from the Dead Man's chair.  Conversations ensued we can not even remember, memory not being too important as the holy now and even now that is so.  There is no time and yet enough time, all of the world's time and no roles or expectations to grow one's hair long or shave off a beard.  Who we are now and what has been heard when nothing was said,  but still I wonder does he know and I hear him in my mind saying yes a thousand times I am saying nothing so loud, and even covering my smile poker faced as the dream is coming forward and the painting of the moon is mine and that school and that park and that is exactly yes and all the ashes in my car or the bowl of vomit left two days now at the foot of the table is nothing compared to nothing compared to nothing compared to.

CONFIDENCE   I am water. I am earth. My parents were fire and air.  I was pulled from the womb unwilling to face the birth canal when another option was possible.  It is always possible.  I come to you now on the verge of discovery. My sails are flowing and I am confident of this wind and this salt air, the canvas blowing filling with colors.  This confidence is like a gift and I appreciate and I endure;  weaving the strands into patterns into make believe and real and something warm to wear.  Life came to me  in summer and footy pajamas.  The fourth generation, baby Polish princess at the top of the aluminum siding castle.  There was a picnic table in the back yard. And my mother was air could she make them like her more by liking me enough.  And my father was fire over books and bad kitchen lighting to hook a career out of this place where he too was born.  We fled to the desert when I was three leaving snows behind and the oven my grandmother used to burn her children's hands with when they were bad.  A new set of grandparents welcomed me like a second birth and there was a kitten for a friend, soon a pool, and a million books of witches and goblins and girls who knew magic.  My mother stayed inside with romance novels and melon ballers and sometimes gin and vermouth but always perfect; coming outside with cut up vegetables and hours working to please the palette of my Dad. She knew her role. She was air. She passed through.  And when I was good I was very very good and when I was bad I was horid.  Sweat pulled off in the dry heat like mirage as I waited for my father to get home to punish me for something done again to my mother.  He was fire. She was air and I was earth and water.  The tension and terror of the beating and having to do whatever she said or else.  This much I remember and nothing more will come to this page today.  I am lifted from the story in a giant helium balloon and carried up up up to the stars and evening night as the sunset hits camelback mountain and saguaros turn purple with goodnight.

GLASS   Light filtered through stained glass cave dwellings,  cool earth floor,  among the red rocks and chips of light break through like points on a map  when everything is warm and kind.  The rock is smooth in my hand, now edges jagged are merged with palm, tendered with lotion and love from all around, and above, beyond, below, beneath, besides, concerning, down, during, except, for, from.  The prepostion parade with clown horns and Shriners whizzing down the streets and squares of Savannah during the St. Patrick's Parade;  and your apartment window two floors above the porta potty while people pissed green;  your stryrofoam head doll painted magical Mona and no idea of direction.  There was only the wind and the dandylions catching, scattering, dispersing, dancing.  Did we dance last night outside Nicotine, didgeridoo pulsing notes and I interrupted you to trace the painted footsteps, fucked up the numbers and turned towards you watching me learning.  But the clouds pass casting shadows layered like stacks of napkins spread in a fan at the bar; swizzle sticks, a rotating fan.  The film is rolling and nothing but everything I ever wanted stands in the way of here and now.  Already the vine is curling tender shoots reaching up like pipe cleaners to twist and play with suck on like ponytail braids and twirl around in the dress like every damsel in distress.  Good god.  May there be light, may there be inner peace and spritual growth for every one of these fuckers like me and you and everybody playing it cool or emptying giblets from paper packages to put in soup to flavor the broth.  I am down with mines and shoulds and sighs. I have enough belief in myself to let it ride 'cause if the worst is down, that is what I am good at.  Spring is here. Step outside.

DISJOINTED   Who am I to tell you to stay and master the infinite complexities of unknown now  when power struggles weigh heavy on the scales shucked off with a borrowed knife and shining in the early light like rainbow fingernails  the missing piece is always missing or it would not be a piece  there are no stand alones or one offs or this or that creation to believe in something better different new  dreams are analyzed and shown on television for the masses wanting reality when truth does not connect them  soft edges the day at home incapable of being the listener to act alone  what purpose vision or adjustment or rain from these clouds heavy and boxes stacked like waiting for something grander or a kick in the ass never coming from one's own foot
DAYLIGHT SAVINGS   Fire does not sit well with me alone in this room still  and sweat is hanging like a heavy too big to hold child  in this room humid airless  and I could go open the windows  and I could turn on the air  but no and not and suffer this martyr I am not satisfied with all of my choice with all of my everything told I can do whatever I want as wanting makes  as desire fufills  as comfort shields my eyes I see nothing but blind  as routine paves my sidewalk I feel nothing under foot  as more advice to stay to not risk to not dare or dream or trust or live  all of the voices stop I have heard all the words from inside before  and this is just another hole and it's for me to decide something new and not worry about right
404   In an instant this one was gone in a blank nothing of return key silence  having filled the virtual page with words so cleansing and even on this one the ending was fabulous  but something happened page cannot be displayed this blog sever down  despair my words were not retained
EXPLAINING THE SILENCE   Three months passed with nothing much to say being on a power high and all or at least thinking I was but the pixie dust washed off in the turpentine bath and all that was left was dirty feet  The answer was not found in that question.  I must have been asking the wrong but how could I know and what made me think and maybe if and what about that and should I shouldn't I would I could I  trust myself to even trust the universe as though stars represent some kind of why enough to make us feel small and I say  no again not this time  running jump and slide  your whole life is this dive down down deep
APPEARANCE   PMS makes more sense than another 10 years of this goddamn job everyone says is so great because it pays the bills  so it goes  as he'd say  as for me I have had enough  as for me my last never is worked  I'd have to be out of my mind to stay another minute  I'd have to be drugged and sacked in burlap  Even that sounds like more fun than another drive on the turnpike  back and forth endlessly  making someone look good
IT ALWAYS COMES TO THIS   the moment of flight  people parachutes  a lead weight a helium balloon  whispers from an alley a stern glance of disapproval  acceptance the unknown  trust shame  the ego's despair  clutching grappling and dusting off  the cape
I CRADLE IF   I cradle If and dress her up like dolls for girls to play with  I hold her hand at the end of the street and look both ways before crossing  Late at night I tuck her in with When and How beside her  If I were If I'd never know fuck is this cadence or what is this shit that's happening
CROSSROADS   Pounding breath is shallow body thick and hard with tense hammering desire to quit to flee to love to be to stop copying and start creating to move on and find the path is still there winding to another crossroads somewhere further on
RSVP   Busting out a tickle pins and needles inside below the rib cage  the urge is so strong to live to create to be become feel free  liberated at last  something unknown magnetic tractor beam pulling me towards the next step  life mapped out and the bread crumbs eaten by forest animals  body draped on the massage table while my neck is pulled and pushed left center right  scolded for wearing my shoulders around my neck and the woman's pecs forgotten  hunching over from too much keyboard caressing  my fingers begin to curl  until at last reminded  death does not have to come by invitation
DIALOGUE WITH YOURSELF   Did you expect to find me here in this location starting out at you  and we I mean you and I being you  you feel who you are talking to who is talking to you from behind these fingertips ever pressing and there is nothing but the abyss of bytes spewing data like stars the universe expanding exploding consciousness in batches recorded here for all to see  like blindness like turning away and what is visual is what is coming to screen  and I am alive here and with you as much as you will let me be  there is brightness illumination signalling and like a race to the finish  you are with me now and who am I but you
ALCOHOLIC   Weak, you drink your strength and become fermented and sour like substance, forever kicking yourself and those you love sober when you are a gentle man;  hard to remember when words are thick as phlegm, subtle as lead pipes against the head;  dissapointing like a lesson unasked for, unlearned,  and all that you were slips through fingers like the water from a poem somebody else wrote who thought he was you.
BETRAYED   2:19 am birthed the Aries moon  while sleeping in my bed.  The morning broke through and I wake  to moving sidewalks, the others passing by and standing, and staring, until workday is done.  I leave the crowd behind to shuffle off  this day's remorse, unmet, unmatched.  Daylight is sucked in  by the mouth of night, inhaled, one gulp,  embers, coals;  and it begins, the nightly ritual, a different sidewalk.  In the moment, you are all light and anything can happen;   does.  You break the spell. You cast a shadow.  You are bitter and darker, fire and ice  side by side; driving me  to write.  You are a comfort to none but the man at the gas station who sold you the cans  and I am the fool again, manipulated, talked about, lied about, tossed around  like worth  as you  piss all over your fan club.
FINISHED   That's it. I have had enough of trying to relate, to change the world, to change myself, to make a difference, to make a dent.  BOOM  Let hope explode.  BOOM  Fireworks of faith.  BOOM  There's nothing left. I have wasted my life living someone else's dream, someone else's expectations.  BOOM  I should be burned at the stake for treason.  BOOM  I should be nailed to the cross for my thoughts, kept inside again, repressed inside again, silent, useless, lonely, ugly, nothing golden bright to offer the universe.  BOOM  Time is running through my fingers and I don't have the answers, these dubloons are melted chocolate stale Easter leftovers, and I am going to hell anyway for tempting married men when I had none of my own, for speaking out too seldom, for dragging my kindness through the coals like it's nothing, like I am nothing to offer but down  while the wheels spin and the roar of the plane, and the polite way the passengers ignore eachother even when someone is screaming.

STAND BY   Disillusioned I soar, a bird who has clipped her own wings, finding at last that I have no fire to offer the universe; it was yours all along.  Alone now I hide, with my gifts unwrapped, bowless, as if the universe cared for another utopian dream, a direction of love pointed to with an open heart by a mute.  And if my tears could turn this dry earth to mud, and if my soil could change the world, then throw me to the flame and let my ashes proof the clay between your hands.  I am nothing. I am no one, at last the liquid poured into sieve of self and gone.  What good is the desire to serve when desire only cuts and divides both halves.  There are pieces of me I will leave behind here, leaving my dreams unfulfilled, my faith in myself crushed by a fist, rumpled into a ball and tossed with so much other rubbish.  So this I will tell you when your voice is back, that I have failed, that I have faltered, that I have gazed into the mirror and reflected none of what you have seen, vision pissed into balloons and cast into the sea.  I am a whimper. I am a moth not a dragon, weak, withdrawn, to retreat to the cage of my fingers, to lock the door without a key.  And in the end, if one will come, I will remember nights without sleep, the weight of my passion, the pounding belief at my door that knocked and knocked and knew no peace.  My back was strong and inside much light, but thought orbits like stars, like earth around sun, the moon which never came, and no certainty as I watched my picture fade.  I knew at any time even now, I could stand, make a decision, and be strong again, bone and blood, but feelings like magnets hold me to this chair, and it is more true not to move now.  Like faucets, like data through cables and I divert my eyes from danger like God's house or salvation, rather inside believing failure when uncertain success may come.  I resign my position of mood director.  I relinquish my smile at strangers, my mind the master, brandishing the whip at every indescretion or indecisive move. It hangs in my solar plexus like indigestion.  I have squandered my power. I have trusted that I could be you and made promises I can not keep.  I have buried myself with a toy shovel and lost my place and lost my way.  I spin and spin to gather speed, bursts of  dull light, explosions of average, my ego kicks and screams echoing down the well.  I will forgive no one, not myself, nor you, nor all of those gardners planting hope and despair.  Not even weeds could sprout through baked desert cracks in my soul.  Even the cactus gave up on rain and shriveled to a stick, thorns still sharp.  Nothing to guess at now, reality unveiled, my pathetic escape plans scrawled over  This is my weakness. Look at the man behind the curtain now, gaze upon her face.  I will ask none of you for help or hinderance, you have suckled me on lies foolish needy trusing lips to nipple, and the dead weight  of my aspirations, and the bullshit faith in my abilities, and the tears that well up now,  unable to keep it together  even for the hour and a half plane ride home.  (written 4/27)
OFF THE HOOK   It's not even nine when there is an attempt to cop-opt my crisis; my story at last told, and everything hangs in air like dreams are not even possible.  The day passes in sleep and the strain of listening to numbers talk, screaming down columns in an Excel spreadsheet 5 cups of coffee can not even animate.  Freedom charges another debit against my account and the messenger hits the floor before the bullets fly.  (written 5/21)
BEFORE AND AFTER    The rain taps its fingers on the tin roof above my patio,  keeping me from a drive North to  Melbourne to check in, luggage in hand,  another night out  before  a morning meeting, and a few words, and a few notes, and a  drive West to  Tampa to check in, luggage in hand, and   another night out.
FOR PHIL   You took a photo of me in stars, black back, and rain dripping down the screened porch.  You gave me comfort but I could not receive.  There were too many thoughts of goodbyes from others ringing in my ears for me to hear what you were saying.  I am surrounded by the aged and forget my youth from time to time.
IN VAIN   There is nothing I have to say that hasn't been felt by someone else and this is my good fortune.  All of the angst and doubt and questions are not in vain if written down and someone should pick up the pieces to rest her head a while.  Some nights it is not so easy to sleep without a pillow.
WILLING   And out of nowhere and everywhere, all is right with the universe and you are back.  I am green haired, laughing, young, hanging on the swimming pool ladder, catching my breath as yours whispers through the line.  Every moment, back and new in the complexity of an almost no.  I understand without.  You remind me so much with every word how yes there is a now, there is a connection we all experience down, and because such love is required, such tenderness that I know from you for everyone in your gentle stories.  The magic you convey is possible in the moment, every moment.  I am singing in these words. I am dancing the steps painted on the sidewalk.  Take my arm in yours. I am willing.
CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE   Silence starting and already I imagine trips to the mailbox, but what the fuck, and why  am I missing something here that has kept my mouth shut tight like duct tape over lips against a terrorist threat.  Light another. Smoke another.  Get this out of my head and down where I can understand nothing better than big talk from someone else,  while I sit and observe, while I sit and perceive.  I am whipped into submission by my reflection.  My tawdry alter ego, the no show, readied for my finale as a failure and no head for numbers, so what will become of me...  I have three days left before I can be myself again and nobody will be there on the other side to hear it.  What have I done and why should I care if I don't don't care when I'm my own nurse writing prescriptions, before the Third Bardo.  For all the promises made to send to me, now will the letters come?  What do you care and why should you care when I am just another stranger or reminder that you have heard everything before and probably said much better.  Is that jealousy?  I have nothing to offer but breath and that which comes natural to dissipate every energy landing here.  Doubt, fear, shame.  This is nothing to contribute and I can't get by on my tits, my looks faded at 5 years old and I'm lucky to hear cute anymore.  Responsible, dependable me.  Why can't I just be alone where no shadows play across the walls I don't cast myself.  Why can't I just be alone and not hear your voice or wonder and wait by the mailbox for something not coming out here now to tell me the truth.  4:05 AM Friday, June 27, 2003
HOW DARK   This dramatic ending was courtesy of T-Mobile.  Sixty seconds on Bradley's phone explained nothing.  I am a greyhound let loose after the rabbit, carting your newest disciple behind me.  Thoughts of this and who I am spark, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  Back at home, wondering who this father he thinks you are is, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  Pieces fly and the jig saw changes the shape on the way down.  I am powerless watching this story play out in not the way I feel.  And I question every question I questioned and the answers that sound different the second time rewound, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  The line to you is cut and words can only get me into trouble later or sooner if I send them.  This is not my half. This is not my whole. This is not my job, my problem, my passion, my possession.  I am lightning. Look at the path.  I am the moon reflected in a pail. Look up.  All my words and all my sorrows have already been taken, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  Go ahead and choose another title for this  meaning less.  It will take longer to explain the sound of my own voice this time.  2:55 AM Friday, June 27, 2003
HEATHEN   These are not the keys I wanted to press 65 days in.  This is not the Sunday afterwards I wanted to spend with you.  I am a balloon that's been deflating for years.  Nobody said anything.  Isn't now too late to raise my hand for air?  This is not the song I expected to be playing for you this month.  This is not the book I wanted to read when I finally let go.  What makes you think you are so special?  What gives you the right to judge and complain?  I am a television series all to myself.  I want to tell my friends to stop right where they are and let me get this down on paper or where is that camera, tape recorder, something.  This is what I am supposed to remember.  Interesting is even better than saved.
BETWEEN THE NOTES   I remember talking with you at the table, you in your assigned place, and me in mine, even though the parents were gone.  You told me I was too young to think about things like the meaning of life,  or what my purpose here  would be.  You are supposed to be out having fun, you told me, and I would ask you  what if thinking about these things was my idea of fun.  I could barely convince myself and you never hid your pity for my petty struggle to find and an answer. between the notes in our conversation.
EQUINOX   Tommorrow is off, put on hold; faith, hope, and love are shelved cans of film, and the jar of ideas is filled with brine awaiting  a different  freedom.  This summer equinox knocks to find me barely awake at its passing and  cursing the light that won't heal another's suffering.  It has rained all day and you tell me 600 persons were evacuated in the flooding when we talk.  There are no fire flies this far into the city anyway and even if the grasses were dry the crickets would not grind any softer.  I have been promised that the meaning of life is time by an uncle I got drunk a dozen Christmasses ago.  I immerse myself in it like a bath of gravy and barely float.  I shovel the walk of it every morning when I wake and notice its passing when the last quarter moon rises behind the clouds.  Decades too young to retire from life, I give up anyway.  I stand accused of dreaming of a world too good  to be real.  Evidence is presented without a spell check in great abundance for the good of the masses.  They tell me their fears and wish me well enough alone, trapped in prisons of their own regret.  I stand inside my cell tonight because I know my way around here even in the dark.
WRITING   Always arriving like an itch nothing can scratch;  not mind, nor hopes, nor mindless cleaning, straightening for the the creation that comes from fingertips,  The night is longer still ahead of me, like wine, like water from glasses played for an audience;  different levels of liquid to appoximate the voice or a guitar left playing by itself, fingers strumming with nobody to hold the instrument.
VIGIL   There are moments when joy doesn't come and all of the talk of God and peace does not fit the hole.  Even faith in the internet shatters under search terms not found.  The emptiness is vast without content.  The void is highlighted in gold and  over and over again outside it sounds like thunder or the sound of trash cans rolled out for the night, planning for the morning when time stands on end, static electricity in hair, the gong sounds.  Time's up.
PRINCESS   Sometimes she can sweep the pages into nothingness; into an eight ball corner pocket, stuffed with her short attention span for present details.  The past ruffles its feathers against  the girl with a lifetime (still short) of boxes filled with collections of what  can not be bought.  Dreams may come, and she may call names  out into the darkness like memory cares enough to answer her at all.  She asks if true love is as real as stars or bright  planetary nebulae, a fuel that burns to tell us something  about our own origins.  All remembered at once, it is sudden as  dissapoint ment  and the gravity of a single misplaced thought, found still searching for the pea under her matress.
WORKAHOLIC   Another sun sets as you stab at your keyboard, fingers drumming replies to the boomerang burst of emails you must answer.  In only a few moments, the time for dinner will have passed, all movies will have already begun, and all of your friends will be in the thick of their plans for the night.  You may believe in the urgency of the greater cause the company has instilled in you, and the idea  of your place in this world from which there is no  clocking out.  So wake at dawn to work but know in the end it is nothing.  The time will come where death  will rock your boat, the loss of a loved one  leaving an anchor deep under your waves, and you will wonder where all those sunsets went and why you were not there to hold her hand at starlight.  You will find that all those trips for work meant nothing, are not even remembered, and even the money left behind is too weak to keep you floating.  Begin to tread now, and gather your strength. Pick up your sail and work with the wind this time, for love is more than greed will ever buy.  You will never be important enough or have enough proof of your worth through any job or any title.  It is quicksand to your self and no matter how much it eats of your soul it will never be full.  Forgive yourself the times you made others do your work so you could ride the corporate coaster.  Forgive yourself the times you couldn't be there because you thought you were too important.  Forgive yourself now for truth does not come easy and without a lesson.  There are many oceans ahead of you to call your home now that you know.
AFTER A DAY AT HOSPICE   How slowly these stages pass, how gradual a slope, and we too are learning while the summer passes by without our concern.  The days lengthen and stretch beyond us while we too  are blanketed by the nurses in kindness and patience.  With Grandma there are moments where she lets me know  with the grip of her hand, she is still here.  Sometimes there is a smile, beautiful beyond skies.  There have been days too where she has comforted me when weak,  my tears falling unashamed by my love for this woman who has given me so much acceptance and concern, a gentle respect for simple truths.  I remember weeks ago, hot from the walk to the Hospice house, I came to her and took her hands in mine. With silence she drew them  to her lips  to blow them cool.  This is love.  It is here I have learned tenderness. It is here I have learned care. These are my thoughts riding my bike home, thanking my legs, my heart, my health.  Home, I hesitate doing what would make me feel good because even the tension in my  shoulders,  neck,  face, reminds me that  you are still here. There is so little time now  for other souvenirs; memories made, forgiveness granted,  and night passes on to another day of lessons and farewells.
ONLY IN DREAMS   Why must love be for another when it can not be against?  Last week I was your lover, wife, favorite friend, and child's mother.  You came to my door with words I long to hear, having scripted them so meticulously, missing nothing.  We spoke from the heart and dreamed in color, filling the skies, traveling through deserts and on high mountain roads.  I gave you the resume of my heart, objective clear, and you responded in delight.  Pity you were not there to experience any of it.  Why must love be for another when it can not be against?
BEFORE THE CREDITS   Maybe the answer is to belong nowhere; let time ride over your back like rain falling through a patch of sun, sing your song into the night to harmonize with locusts, breathe, embrace moments even spent in woods, and if a tree falls then who cares.  There have been crueler summers, the time to let my heart out to play, learning there is beauty too in suffering.  I am more than less I was as dogs bark and the room is still save the ceiling fan having it's own gentle caress on my shoulders.  I bleed willingly, joyfully, believing in magic over cold logic and thoughts dancing, meaning nothing.  Real is as real does. The movie playing in my mind is a double feature. I order vegetable foo young and select this seat.
THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE   For seven years I have lived next door to a mermaid.  At night, she hangs her tails from the line stretched across her car port.  I know her name and she knows mine.  The rest of my neighbors are strangers, stranger still these days filling spaces with SUVs and children taken in hand.  I have outgrown this home and am outclassed, and am outmortgaged, and am outside taking the recycling out for Friday wondering how it all got so different from me.
CUT THE STRING   I imagine I will always have this feeling of vague dissastisfaction.  One minute there is endless opportunity, the goal is in sight, then the finish line, then nothing left to cross.  I remind myself.  Another ending is near, and in the end it doesn't ever matter how good it all sounded then.  I have people to face and balls of yarn to unravel, trim, and snip off.  Perfection isn't possible and what are dreams for if not to wake from.  I seek a new path to absorb myself into.  I will avoid those who suffer from self-importance this time.  I have paid for my admittance to this show in more ways than one.  July is change and letting go and the universe seems a lot more trustworthy to me than people if I am any example.  The balloon rises into the sky and is caught by the wind up, up, up.
CLOSER   Holding in feelings, drawn and quartered by possible fantasies and improbable futures, I am in wonder and awe.  She gave me a sample bottle of perfume called Miracle to use for such adventures but so far no water has turned to wine.  I am beside myself, inside myself, rehearsing and rehashing, afraid to pick up the phone to call you in the event it may ring.  You are living in a different time I know too well to pretend now my minutes pass the same as yours, measured for mixing in metric increments.  The window of opportunity this time is known and days pass towards your arrival as though leaning forward.  I am unsure about all but my feelings and what I am willing to sacrifice in their name.  Such statements come easy but I am all about the imagined.  It is what I know, eyes full of stars, and an inner knowing of just how the moon will look tonight rising above water.
GO ON   For five days, I have been without my mirror.  I guess if this shirt looks right with this skirt with this look, sideways glancing, is this really me?  It is spring at the pi\F1ata party. My amnesia has lifted  from the time I was hit by the bat. I am looking around at all the kids.  Tonight even the poet asks where the moon is and in Gemini, even I look rational.  Thoughts stretch out in the sun and flip.  Everyone else has found the answers but me.  I have spent my life interviewing the wrong  person.
STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS   If I could quiet my thoughts, wrap the bundle in  soft and warm, to crib for naps or watching stars,  would the unknown make itself a little less obvious?  All day I have been beyond behind wonder and not knowing, pretending bliss,  the gift of lack of commitment.  I am too far removed and too soon confused.  I am missing out on missing out.  Could there be a balance in geography, a new spot to look on the map, easier on the neck?  Snap around and fall  in line?  I am breaking the rules still but  still not enough.  And in a round, my generation sings.  We apologize to all of those who have sacrificed their lives in the hope we would be more than what we have become.  You should have asked us first what we were capable of.
GROWING WINGS   Like an outpouring from the void, not even knowing what will be said next, it all comes together in a chorus of what to dos.  The eternal question of being strong enough for someone else too, you ask without a question mark.  There is always fear of never being enough for these mistakes offered up like proof.  I have not turned the air conditioner on since I have been home, a someplace I have been before, which surrounds me like a fog that does not come up through the trees at seven o'clock in the morning.
CLUES AND ILLUSIONS   At this point it doesn't really matter what I say to sound coming off like a nothing, something, maybe more or less, not.  These images flash, and I am unsure again of who I  was when I was what I was,  to be found this close to home without a conscience carved in honest mistakes.  Best wait for something resembling silence to take the place of feeling out of place, pointed at.  No competition is worth having.  We were meaning something even I can't understand;  like a song going through your head that won't quit and singing it to someone else only makes it worse.  A spotlight on the stage or behind walls is more or less the same.  Burn out the light by leaving it on too long or shadow this crevasse into camouflage.  It makes no difference.  Words must come out somewhere after all and targets are slow to come by.  To know oneself as a monster and angel containing equal parts is a poorly bargained balance.  Deny nothing. Keep to yourself.  Keep your hands in the car at all times.  Rhetoric and righteousness from too shaky a foundation, is roughness  and  sand castles.  What could you have been if you had just been you, if you'd only known that then?  Who else do you expect to forgive and forget the truth of  too much from too much?  It all comes out in the wash said someone helping even now, in ways I can not see, in ways I can not see.
ONLY STARTS   In the in between,  between fear and flight,  choices breeze through chance, opportunities tease,  and  voices never echo the same through the open door,  closed by passers by.  Single light switch, socket, the pulsating electric puzzle, writhing like  tommorow;  procrastination finely tuned for the recital;  Mars coming closer to earth than what could mean something wrong.  The planets rarely align for despair or disasters yet to come.  More is wished into the energy vacuum than all the worlds pennies buying nothing these days.  Paint over the mess you thought you made with your life.  Pull off that protective vinyl cover.  The suits were made for flight and in the end, it's only starts.
STILL NOT COMING BACK   I could probably stay awake for the rest of my life in frenzied marathon poetry writing.  It started as a tickle, or a gash, I felt after purging my home of your wood.  Big trash day is coming to take away the rest of you and I returned all of your memories before asking you to please go; you will never do, you will never do.  And as I boast of my pain, I can only imagine what fears take hold of you as you drive away again always never turning back to take me into you arms.  You apologized to me when we parted from our embrace this afternoon.  "I am sorry I am not what you need," you assured me as you let me go.  You never knew that all I asked of you was to keep holding me just a little longer, but knowing that was not worth the asking.  written 8/4/03 4:25am
AND THEY ARE OFF   I write without stopping like someone has shot a gun and the race is on.  To be fair, I allow for breaks this time.  To be proper, I forgive those  critics whose  jobs were to set me straight on a number of important details  such as;  creativity is all well and good but keep within the established rules,  and  love is a blessing even when you don't exactly have it in the way that you thought about it,  and hey what about a little fucking humor  from time to time to break through.  Because I have gone back now in time and read your words,  and they were not meant even for me here feet on table, legs slagging over the edge, cigarette smoked, and getting smaller again, as I am want  to do once I get too full of myself.  I am wiser now by far then the girl I was.  Nothing is quite so dark and grim and I never talk about hell anymore so it must be resolved.  I mortared many bricks to build this fine home using tools I was well taught  duty  loyalty  obligation  sacrifice  They paid the bills and brought me hunks of marked acrylic with my name in the center.  Let someone else get the applause. It wasn't all that and in the end less mattered than I might have thought once I awakened to the reality of who I was sleeping inside those realtor looking jackets and sweating leather flats I kept in abundance in the trunk of my car in case I were to forget to wear shoes to work again.    written 8/4/03 4:12 am
GUSTS   Another wind blows me into the tunnel; the concrete pipe kids crawl in and out of, but I stayed.  I claimed the walls as my own still refusing birth.  Inside, I asked the others to tell me the truth and they did.  They were too slow to come up with any questions for me and nobody could match my hours of practice asking questions into the void, the abyss that fed me mother's milk while I scrawled marks on the walls to measure time.  It's all here, all of my secrets revealed again, and if I forget another time then yes, again, I will seal the capsule with packing tape one more time and cast my bottle into the sea.  written 8/4/03 3:53 am
LOOP   Expression of which is covered over begs for approval removal.  All your life you have known who you really are.  Sometimes it bubbles to the surface like translucence rainbowing in the sun.  Sometimes it pricks like a pebble  in an ice skate laced up tight, buried layers  deep down in the sock.  You never really cared  to own your own laughter or delight shared with others still fearing their own shadows, but La Ventana is open wide, proof enough that water can wear down the earth.  Wind too, can wash away the strongest stone.  Emanate and luminate past the stairs of wonder. Even the way down is up from here.  You are here on  temporary assignment on a fixed track, in the last car, approaching the final climb.  Throw your arms wide into the sky and squeal your way to the end.  You have an all day pass from here on out.
CLOSER UP   To whom may you sacrifice your needs to prove?  For whom do you toil and ponder nights spent awake, easing the way for dawn?  Letting go these images, the after burn of dreams, edges petal crisp, pixilated closer up, eat dot made from another pattern.  Whose timeline serves you best? Have you chosen your master well? Do you seek another's hands on your will?  The time will not come  for you to ask  these questions again, in this way, or with this urgency of command.  Relinquish the lust for results, acknowledging the answers given you didn't ask for.  Nothing can slip through fingers, even held tight, like impatience when a tunnel is bored into the earth or the flesh for a break through centuries overdrawn.
ON PURPOSE   In times of fear, we all fall back on what we think we know to be our strengths when our weakness  makes us more human.  In a robot vision of life, in step with the crowd or with those breaking free, all of the indecisions are abandoned for better distractions.  In the microwaveable vision of life, time is saved by not wondering purpose or planning for trips not yet taken;  and everyone has answers they are willing to share.  The meaning of life is waiting for you at the convenience store up the street, from the man you see everyday who may not even know your name or the brand you buy;  and everyone has answers they refuse to speak of.  They have a lot to do with that (w)hole you are trying so hard to fill.  So...  Dance to another man's beat.  Sing the lyrics you didn't write.  Stare into the photo you didn't take.  Creativity is for what practical purpose anyway or should that question anchor  elsewhere.  Creativity is for what conversation going on under the surface, projecting as anger or disagreement, or a million things not talked about because there is one thing still undiscussed.  What if you were the answer?  What if you were the center?  Commitment is  even harder to make to ones self than  to another when stubbornly, the dream refuses to let go when the alarm clock goes off, and  still nothing to do on purpose.
WAVE PARTICLES   Tired of sustaining the illusion, she cracks another whip and the music resumes,  Lonlied by me, my and mine, she parts the waves  to bring the boats to shore a prettier face  could have launched into battle.  The night slides into tomorrow, skids past midnight, then thud.  A few pieces are still missing from next week.  Destiny calls and a few are left on hold for way too long.  Apologies inner tube down the river in tank tops and flip flops.  The window of opportunity was dangled before the point of no return and all of the crickets left for better acoustics someplace else.  So what to stay and retrieve... the soul.  So what to stay and believe... the soul.   Nothing matters more than (fill in the blank) filtered through sand.
THE MOON WAS STILL UP   Anger and pain I can not understand because they are so far underneath your skin even poetry does not release from you their rewards.  You compete against the music played to drown you out on purpose as though guitar light could flood the landscape yesterday bright or for pieces of the puzzle glued on cardboard to signify an end.  Struggle is synthesized into the equalizing waves of water washing over a brand new day and you are the  lighthouse again against rocky shores.  Memory unlatches the paper petroglyphs at exactly the right time even though the words are too faint to hear over the lyrics of Van Morrison or the possibility of being completely wrong about all of it.
DISSEMINATING ARIES   Even though the night fades, I hold the connection like sunrise sings the moon to sleep and drives truth into hiding for memories of future hopes of meaning.  Nothing has come true yet but it doesn't matter.  As long as there is breath to explain the similarities of shadows passed in misdemeanors of youth's lost excuses for being someone.  Regulating behavior is completely within the rights of the individual or so the law states.  Guidelines are drawn out poster big and glossy or matte depending on the given day or what can be given.  The stand still between answers to questions posed or swords drawn for a fight to the death of the ego.  Not everyone was famous in their past lives and some of us even are supposed to be who we are exactly as we are right now regardless of who likes it, and those that do.  Those who will be with us always are no less worthy of lifting up into truths known by all to be remembered by some.  The burden of keeping silent is celebrated only at the first sign of sound.  And though there may be more than nothing to it, I am found here in your loss more than you were known to be like me, straightening my spine as rainbows climb my back.
BACK AND FORTH   There have been truths told and promises broken over and over again like time passes through street corners summer has neglected and passed her judgment on before songs stop the conversations going nowhere.  The middle path is a reminder and echoes fly like hawks high above La Ventana calling me home as time is marked in different countries.  Over everything and nothing, no blame comes; the farewells are predicted in tea leaves, the strained voice of someone knowing there is nothing so something as the peach tree orchard of lost virginities and misled suitors looking for magic, rabbits dead in the hat.  The next song starts on speaker phone and she is beyond understanding his control or the drummer boy playing in the background without frankincense or louder still to drown out fingers stretching across time.  He asks her if she has found enlightenment yet or if she knows what love is.  In this state or that. with control, or without control, or with the knowing glances, the smiles at men with chests pressed out.  The owl that came to her on the patio looked in her eyes for truth before the matter was examined, and we heard the same music for the first time pretending it was not the second time this has not happened before or it was not the first time this has happened again before  air on the neck, the ceiling fan, the fan on the floor, the wind that calls from canyons in Farmington, secrets of not giving yourself completely enough over until the end.
MILAREPA'S DANCE   Maybe dreams are just the  overreaching of money's excuse for not being real enough or owning pain rented out.  My grandmother was dying as the paid nurse held her hand and  I asked my Mother if this is what money buys.  In silent shame I knew  the truth no books  are bold enough to hold  the words for.  I am born of this wound made in the earth by accident.  I look to the sky for answers in the clouds free to all.  I look to the sky for the moon rising, reliable as egg letting go of womb.  She is the woman he is looking for and he doesn't believe she exists.   Even still her hands stretch out, thumb and forefinger holding the fragile peace.  Even still her breathing lights up the room darker than he knows reaching out in ways he can not see, can only feel and she understands.
I COME TO THE DESERT   I come to the desert  to find my past, reconnect with roots  buried in hard soil played on in childhood, Creosote smells foretelling distant rain the heat evaporates before landing.  I come to the desert  to find my past, branches of my heart dried like cactus bones, asking acceptance from this earth or these Indian eyes, or these Mexican smiles, who glance over me like forgiveness is all I can earn here under this white skin.  White like klan robes, white like eyes opened wide, white like lies told for victories never won in justice.  I come to the desert  to find my past at the National Atomic Museum, and learn about Nobel scientists, skin mushroom cloud white like mine, and I am demanding to know the half-life of truth.  I come to the desert  to find my past at the Pueblo museum in plaques defining 19 tribes, each with a paragraph describing their survival among the greed of conquerors using God as a weapon with skin white like mine.  I come to the desert to find my people at the museum  of Hate and Intolerance, but the gates are closed, guarded by silent kachinas skin bright and bold, not white like mine.  I come to the desert  to find my purpose at a poetry reading, revealing injustices and lost identities boiled down in this melting pot and listen  as though in the truth  of another, some answer may be found, but in an instant am shattered when a note scrawled on napkin is passed to me, "This is not Starbuck's," a message for skin white like mine.  I come to the desert  to find my homeland  for I am removed  three generations from my name.  Perhaps it would be better to find my past in the Polish family who came to this United States to escape their torturers and build generations who could speak the language, who would not have to break backs  and cramp fingers in the tobacco fields, picking and sweating and laying leaves across wood to dry.  I am told these were my people, strangers to me, I was carried away to the desert when I was three. I was not told their stories until the summer Stasia took me to Chu Chu's to hear her memories of being in the Catholic concentration camp with her son Billy.  It was seven years  before they escaped, after the war was over,  but before liberation came.  I come to the desert because these stories do not truly belong to me, and I cannot find comfort in Chu Chu's words at the end of her tale, "the Jews deserved it," her ancient face revealing eyes still unforgiving, betraying her frailty.  She was dead four years before I was told.  So I come to the desert, seeking community and culture only tasted at restaurants, licking my lips, the color on my body and deny my race, for I am not white, I am beige, beige like these desert sands, beige like these hard rock mountains.  I am beige in the sun.  I darken my skin in the shadows.  I stand alone, the last of my family line, the family who worked to give me the freedom  to buy a new history for myself among the madness of conquerors  enslavers liars murderers skin white  like the blisters  on my beige  heels, as I walk the desert to find  the sacred space to heal  my common humanity.
SOMEPLACE NEW AGAIN   I have had it with trolling for visions. The fish never bite and  I feel kind of funny pulling them up from the depths, considering the bends and all.  Though flashy colors and neon  have always caught my fancy, I realize there is more to pretty than that which remains when eyes  are closed.  Life is everywhere and I am.  Life is a kaleidoscope and I am up late feeling  the magic of dreams cast by my neighbors, and happiness  is found in simply being happy.  After all,  freedom isn't about freeing everyone else.  Let everyone find his own cloud monsters and  try to break them up with the power of his will alone.  Let everybody find her own set of flannel sheets to sleep comfortably at night.  We ride our bikes on parallel paths and I am  no more than just a few inches from you.  We climb our mountains with the same  weight of gravity tugging at our boots and I have no idea if this rope will hold.  The end result is never really an ending, but begin here just in case you think you have arrived someplace new again.
FROM FLAMES   If there were an answer, then the questions would stop, and with nothing left to ask, only silence could recognize you.  I have reached to the stars, I have followed shamans to their sleeping shadows, passed the sighs of discontent, crept down stairs of sameness, felt the pains of misunderstood strangers wanting to be loved for that spark of light the others ignored in them.  I dusted them off  and shined them up, as though God cared for something cleaner than strength while night folded in on itself, while time marked herself with one leg raised and love rested unrequited for a while.  What's not to be afraid of for those who wait for even the first step  to emerge from the abyss or  their leg to twitch  towards liberation.  I followed that map to oblivion time and time again  until I realized it was only  a representation.  I gagged and bound my ego in retribution and drove past the dream of being more than myself by being the Self, the ultimate trip up down the path of illusory greatness.  Still the songs played on like trickling fingertips  on skin, light and playful and  wanting.  Still the lyrics illuminated the more than enoughness  of love regardless  of regard.  And night folded in on herself, marking time with man made clocks towards our own (un)timely demise or  time to arise from these flames like the Phoenix with brightly colored wings who flies because she can.  Flap, flap, flap.
A STEP CLOSER TO STEPPING OFF   Voices raised like hands above heads, like waves  of fingers piano playing the air, accidental harmonies wanting  an end or just wanting  more.  The world spins out of synch, faster and hotter, like water spills like steam rises, like warm mud  or the soft underbellies of earth worms, making their way home while everybody goes about his business.  Drums beat to  mark the passage; the young girls dance while the boys look on, ying and yang pushed to a crescendo, cutting through the cage, as if victory is nothing more  than  a barrier breached again  and again.  For whose benefit are these metaphors and significances and coincidences?  For whose reward are these smiles and knowing winks and a nudge and a nudge and a nudge?  Wrong, wrong, wrong but will  we know right  when we see it?  Bad, bad, bad but will we know good when we see it?  The opposites define themselves into each other, merging and melting into the mud, and the earthworms go about their business, while everybody makes her way home.  The shouting turns to singing, turns to whispers, turns to laughter, turns to silence and then a rest between notes.
GERMINATION   The flowers you gave me are beginning  to open on my window sill; red rose taking on a new shape as the day progresses, overpowering the black-eyed susans.  As a gift to Spot, I bring the vase out to the patio where he sprawls  in catlike bliss on the current dining room table.  Stretching out, he purrs, rubbing his face into the leaves, losing his balance in wonder over the smells, and the leaves, and the tiny yellow petals reaching out from their branches  until a lizard catches his eye and it's just me here, remembering the bouquet held in your hands the night before  last.
RIGHT NOW   letting it all come and go and flow without regard to time or spaces between us and  even words and even dreams and even and even  gentle strength  learning not to direct the waves but to sink soar rise the crest and soft back into petals  those times when you are not and those times when you are  the right balance towards upwards the middle path and back down casting no rings on the water
emergence and separation   In no time at all and all time, the words from fingertips are creeping to the surface.  Cross the bridge, open the gate;  and it's all countless tribes of butterflies and  the passing  from moon, to sun, to moon, to sun, only clouds can deny the eye.
TOO LATE   Not writing has become a metaphor for my life; instead of finished work behind me, ahead lies scraps of started interrupted thoughts, leading to what is unknown at present;  and I am behind myself, watching like talons underfoot tickle gashes, moving still under currents, thoughtless, running from something, giving up the dream again all too soon, again all too late to never finish the painting or poem.  What half am I trying so hard to whole with;  complete my self, male, female, animal;  and  planets spin and align, and astrologers interpret for the apathetic masses.  I shined too bright to be believable and when daybreak crashed against the bedroom wall, I was too hungry for the comfort and warmth of eyes and arms and legs to wrap around to tell the truth to even myself;  finding out too late, just as good as never finding out at all.
UNWRAPPED   Yesterday afternoon, we weeded  our first garden and  tilled the soil.  Now each  breath we take  is a greater symbol  than jumping  from a plane.  Your fingers touch mine and  the perfect fit of the palms together are more  than two breaths finding rhythm.  Each day more is unwrapped and contents  spill from morning, to afternoon, to evening.  I am below and above and beside it all, looking forward as if  it's the first time that direction  ever existed for me at all.
Cloud  Space   During the time when you have not  yet been to life or death;  everything everyone told you was important;  still  is.  Dreams are something to interpret to find your inner questions.  All purposes must have a goal at the end to cross and the sooner, the better.  You have not yet seen the bricks.  Cloud space on blue sky that should be white.  What is clear but the absence of something blocking.  Less to edit endlessly in the head and  the players still seeming to act from a different script.  Before the veil is lifted, before it is too indescribably beautiful to believe, innocent as the smooth skin on the side of a blade of grass, and you might even forget sometimes to look at the sunset or to remember when the moon will next be full.  Easier  to love in another while simply passing through the absence of clouds.
reflecting the sun   In what ways does life change; thoughts going through and out alongside 64 violins the night the spiritual leader of Palestine was assassinated, just holding  your hand;  to go forward with a dream lived now,  in even the journey north  together;  just to see your face in the morning,  again and again;  and warm skin touching somewhere before sleeping positions are established.  So many stories still untold and  a language left to learn and experiences to share;  while the Aries moon scatters her seeds into  the earth;  rises, wispy outline but still there  reflecting the sun.
BACK FROM NOWHERE   For weeks the wind has been howling backwards, blowing not a leaf but the sound and  the rumble inside is like a passing train.  The whistle never blows here in this town too far from major arteries; still there are tracks to cross back and forth and  harder  on a bike.  And this is home now.  I keep reminding myself how happy I am to have so much shade again.  I keep reminding myself how lucky I am  to have found someone who will live with me and my faults, little lines that open up the earth with a crack to fill with water.  And I keep reminding myself that it's okay to live without forever, it was only a word anyway.  Nights like these, the distant traffic sounds from Waldo Road are as comforting  as any waves reaching the shore but I still strain to hear a few planes or the helicopter landing on Broward General or searching for crime.  It's small town life and my space  is smaller too.  I'm still learning to share. It's so much easier for me to give.  You are asleep now, resting for work and dreams I do not understand.  Sometimes I wonder  if we weren't closer apart.
TWITCH   Blepharospasm is another way of saying an eye twitch; different than a blink or a wink; unexpected now and utterly unwanted.  They say it's stress related but I don't want to look inside anymore for answers.  Haven't I opened that door, let in wind through that window, and buried myself whole in a hole where the rain came... but it didn't even work last time anyway and how am I supposed to get health insurance with a record like this playing on...skip...skip.
record scratches on the harmonica solo   Grieving myself into I box, I saw the sun through narrow slits, and clouds forming and the voices of all the arms around me drawing near, too near.  Each is in her own stage of dying down the mattered ways of age and giving up something for lent.  A thousand opportunities to grow and close and dance alone as one,  the dust rising from the road below his feet,  as thunder invites the rain forward in time.  Beasts and burdens, the bud opening again and again rather than giving up the flower pot.  A daisy in your hair or a paper airplane and still these questions slam dunk, rock the surface of the walls until the paint peels off like wallpaper and  someone is still not here.  No fortune left to chance as the craving of the ring moves like shadows on the movie theater wall, tickles the projectionist for a moment, then moves on.  And we are not the wind. And we are not the sail. And we are not the ship, the bow, the galley.  And we are not the passing hour, the memory of yesterday's tomorrow. muddled through, hands still clenching like a baby's fist.  Knowing who you are is all the more reason to fight the form, only half of what could be if letting go were that easy.  Merge me into your flesh and give me a reason to stay in the now longer than a blink.  Welcome me home, distracting the ending one more time.
wonka's soliloquy on the wonkatania    there's no earthly way of knowing  which direction we are going  there's no knowing where we're rowing  or which way the river's flowing  is it raining  is it snowing  is a hurricane a-blowing  bleh!  not a speck of light is showing  so the danger must be growing  are the fires of hell a glowing?  is the grisly reaper mowing?  yes! the danger must be growing  for the rowers keep on rowing  and they're certainly not showing  any signs that they are slowing!   we're there

urlLink Current Phase: Full Moon in Aquarius   This Full Moon is in the sign of Aquarius, opposite the Sun in Leo. This polarity is symbolic of individual needs [Leo] vs. collective ones [Aquarius]; attachment vs. detachment; individuality vs. groupidentity. The challenge is to allow them to work together harmoniously. This can be tough, since emotional energy is usually quite heated around the Full Moon period, and many may be touchy and oversensitive. Give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and use the intensity of this lunation to focus on productive matters pertaining to your sign.  The Full Moon period signifies the peak of the waxing Moon energy... a great time to focus on spiritual, magical energies in order to direct them through meditation or personal ritual. Many also focus once again on the goals that were set at the previous New Moon, and utilize the intensity of the Full Moon to release their intentions to the Universe with gratitude and respect.

If you were born during the new moon phase, you are impulsive, passionate, instinctive, a risk taker, and a pioneer. The new moon rises at sunrise and sets at sunset. She is not visible in the sky
Current Phase: Balsamic in Taurus  After the winnings are gathered up and the points are on the board, another game still goes on. Despite all accomplishments, larger questions always loom. After the second breaking point between Antithetical and Primary, we find those people who always take a deeper look. Sometimes they are driven to extremes by what they see. Sometimes they become the moral proprietors of their societies. In the end, it is only the freedom of the mind to understand.  The fourth quarter pushes beyond where social traditions (Instinct), gut feelings (Emotion) and mental brilliance (Intellect) can go. This is the place where all that experience is weighed in the balance of the big picture.  Balsamic phase is the best time for destroying weeds, pruning trees, and all preparation for the next cycle.  Sources:  urlLink PanPlanet    urlLink MoonPhase.net

Current Phase: Last Quarter Moon in Gemini  The Last Quarter Moon brings a period of reflection and reevaluation. Internally, you are reorienting your priorities away from what has already transpired toward something new. Your focus now is on achieving the realization of a deeper meaning in your life. You may find yourself questioning your beliefs and values and discarding what no longer fits in order to make room for what you are discovering about yourself. Ultimately, this can bring about a complete turning away from something that was once important to you. You have the potential now to break through old limitations and release what no longer works for you. While you may not yet have a clear vision of where you're heading next, know that in tearing down old structures you're opening the door for new, exciting dreams to take root.

Current Phase: Last Quarter Moon in Leo  Monday 9:27 PM PST Sun 5\BA Leo  The Leo Moon nurtures our very life force, helps us grow and see our beauty, our strengths and our talents. A Leo Moon nourishes and protects our ability to hold onto the child inside and to take risks to experience the truth of love and enjoyment. Expect dramatic and energized emotions. Many of the natural characteristics of the Moon are absorbed and nullified when she is in Leo, the natural domicile of the Sun. Key word is Pride. The Moon in Leo also strengthens the influence of the Sun, and right now, the sun sits in Scorpio.  The last quarter phase lets you know it's time to adjust your attitude and follow new inspirations.   Leo Traits:  Enthusiasm for self and others expressed in an authoritative and proud manner.

Current Phase: First Quarter in Capricorn  The Moon is the First Quarter Moon when it separates from the Sun (after a New Moon) at an angle of 90 degrees (square). This square (which looks like a half moon in the sky) asks us to take care of the small things that grow into big uncomfortable things. If tensions come up, it's because you need to look at some part of a relationship or emotional structure in your daily life that just isn't working right and may need more thought. The First Quarter Moon is the first aspect since the New Moon that asks us to look at our newly devised plans from a distance that gives us a first glimpse of objectivity. This can create a sensitive issue or it can give you the resolve necessary to make improvements and keep going.    Capricorn Traits:  Capricornians are ambitious, resolute, cold minded, melancholic. Fatigue never makes them afraid, they work hard and are ready to sacrifice themselves, if necessary. They plan patiently and carefully all their objectives and the way to reach them. To achieve their results they are ready to do anything, without asking any help. They are reserved and introverted, but sometimes they live sudden moments of impulsiveness. Their main characteristics are shyness and insecurity which disappear when they realize of being loved and appreciated.  Sources:  urlLink ArtCharts    urlLink RealMagick
Current Phase: Gibbous in Aries  Begins Friday 2:38 PM PST / Ends: Tuesday 5:34 PM PST  The key of this phase seems to be about focusing on oneself, and not turning too much of an intense eye towards others' imperfections. This is the last phase of the first half of the cycle, so it is meant to be very much self-oriented. The Gibbous Moon is best spent with deep awareness of oneself, in preparation for the Full Moon or relationships. The symbolic new moon seed now buds.   About Aries (Ruler Mars):  The first sign of the zodiac has an aggressive self-assertive quality. Planets in Aries take on an initiating, fiery, and highly active disposition. When positively aspected Aries can be accomplishing, highly self-confident, and apt to draw a following due to the pronounced leadership abilities. When negatively aspected, planets here take on a selfish energy, one which acts too quickly and leaps into situations head-first without proper preparation. Aries is the first to get things started and can be combative when blocked or denied.  Sources:  urlLink Astrology for the Soul    urlLink Zodiac House

Current Phase: Full Moon in Gemini  Begins Thursday 2:11 PM EST / Ends: Monday 7:19 AM EST  The Full Moon is the time when the Moon reflects the greatest amount of the Sun's light. The Earth is astronomically poised between the Sun and the Moon, enabling us to see two different sides of ourselves clearly, something the Gemini energy is adept at spotting. The opposing but equally-pulling gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon also reveals a tension within ourselves. The polarity of Gemini is Sagittarius.The polarity of a sign, is the sign that is opposite it in the zodiac. Since we are in the Sagittarius lunar cycle, that tension may be more pronounced.  By providing enough distance and light to give us an objective view of ourselves and how we relate to others, the Full Moon works to integrate and harmonize the contradictions in ourselves and others. This opening of increased awareness traditionally makes the Full Moon a beneficial time for meditation on personal and worldwide issues. There's literally an electrical energy build-up before a Full Moon and a release just after the peak. At the Full Moon, the seeds sown at the last New Moon are ready to be harvested and used ~~ we reap what we've sown. Working out the energy through the physical body can be grounding and centering.    About Gemini (Ruler Mercury):   The Astrological Symbol of Gemini is the Twins. Like their sign, the twins, they often have a dual nature and are skilled at seeing both sides of a problem, but they may also be fickle and restless.  Within the Zodiac, Gemini is opposite Sagittarius, the sign of philosophy. While Sagittarius tends to have one major interest that is studied deeply, Gemini people tend to have many different interests they study in less detail.  The element of Gemini is air. Air is vital to human survival. Without air, we would perish. Air is the power of movement; of freshening and of intellignce. It\92s the invisible and yet quite real mixture of gases that we breathe in every day. The three air signs are Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. In astrology, air stands for intellect, reason and communication. The quality of Gemini is mutable. The four mutable signs Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. In astrology, the mutable quality signifies versatility, adaptability, openness to change, and flexibility.   Gemini - Full Moon Meditation   from  urlLink The Labours of Hercules    \ABI recognize my other self and while this fades I grow and glow.\BB (May 21 - June 20)  This full moon meditation series is based on an astrological interpretation of the twelve labors of Hercules from the Greek myth. The twelve tasks of Hercules are symbolic lessons for every human from the way of selfishness back to the Heart of God. As mortals we do not exactly know the way to the higher worlds but the path itself knows and leads us through sometimes dramatic experiences to our goal. So we travel "on the path until we become that path", from Aries to Taurus and Gemini - and further through all the astrological signs to Pisces. In Gemini active work sets the standard tone. First comes the premonition, later the certain knowledge; eventually we recognize through daily work - after mental control in Aries and overcome desire in Taurus - the light of God everywhere.  In the third sign of the astrological year, Gemini, the Twins, Hercules is called again from his own inner light to go further and accept the next task: Go out to search the sacred tree and gather the golden apples of the Hesperides. Unfold the power to search without discouragement, deception or too great speed. Perseverance holds the key.  The task appears to be easy and Hercules hurries into it. But the garden of the Hesperides is protected by a hundred-headed dragon and three virgins. Throughout the land Hercules passes, seeking the sacred tree, but without success. He is deaf to the inner voice and blind for all signs along the way. From North he turns to South and wrestles with Antaeus, the serpent in the place of darkness. Antaeus overcomes him at every point until Hercules is able to lift the serpent, with both arms, high in the air, off from the ground. To the West Hercules now turns with new courage. He meets Busiris, the great deceiver, son of the waters, who pretends to know the truth alone. Hercules loves and adores Busiris, follows him and becomes bound by him for a whole year. Finally Hercules turns inwards and realises that "Truth lies within yourself". So he breaks the bonds and continues with the search wiser than before. A pain-filled screem intrudes the ear of Hercules, the one of Prometheus, chained upon a rock, his liver being hacked by vultures, thus slowly killing him. Hercules breaks the binding chain, frees Prometheus und looks after him until he recovers from his wounds. With much loss of time Hercules turns to the high mountains of the East, meeting Atlas on his way carrying the load of worlds upon his back. Hercules watches and gauges the measure of the load and pain. He forgets about his search and decides to aid the giant without delay. So he shoulders the burden of his brother unto his own back. But lo! the load rolls off and he stands free and likewise Atlas. From the loving hands of Atlas he gets the long awaited golden apples. Three sisters - Aegle, Erythea and Hesperis - await him with more apples declaring "The Way to us is always marked by service. Deed of love are signposts on the Way". The story ends with Hercules returning the apples to the three sisters "for those who follow".  The sign of Gemini consists of two pillars connected with a half-moon shaped arch: One pillar is open at the bottom, the other at the top. They symbolise the lower nature (body, feeling, mind) and the higher Self (atma-buddhi-manas). The pairs of opposites reveal themselves especially forceful in this sign - the higher Self striving upwards, the form aspect drawing downwards. Five tests Hercules has to pass before the fruits of Wisdom become his own: Sincerity, Alertness, Persistence, the Unfolding of Power for the search, and - finally - the selfless loving Service for others.  In Gemini, we learn to recognize the presence of the Higher Self. In the beginning one is aware of voice but does not hear, one sees or has a premonition of some danger but is blind until all assumptions and beliefs are transformed into knowledge and experience. Prometheus stands for the escape from the bondage of the mind, Atlas symbolizes the freedom and readiness to carry "the Weight of the World". Both, Prometheus and Atlas are witnesses on the way to our awareness of the higher Self. Loving compassion born of right thinking will lead us towards the goal. The keynote signifies that the lower nature (body, feelings and mind) - symbolized in the lower pillar of the sign - has to fade and become submerged to the higher Self which will then grow and glow.

Current Phase: Full Moon in Leo   Sunday 3:52pm PST until Wednesday 11:26 PM PST when it moves into Libra   Leo has a real sense of specialness and perceives all it creates as gifts bestowed upon the rest of us in the name of love and life. Anything can happen under the influence of this most romantic of Moons. Leo loves to be the center of attention, so get out there and shine! For those of you who made commitments to life changes on the New Moon in Aquarius, this is the time to put those plans into action. You get to begin your new life with the self-confidence of a Leo Full Moon opposing Uranus in Aquarius, which represents the radical energy to throw out the old and bring in the new. The Venus and Chiron conjunction in Capricorn will give you added strength to achieve your goals; no matter how hard and long it takes. Remember that on a Full Moon, it helps to release your old behavior through ritual. This is a Full Moon of great inspiration and should not be wasted. If you have been suffering with creative blocks, the Leo Full Moon bestows the energy to break free of inertia and get into action. If it doesn't, you might reconsider your project or direction. Maybe it's just not the right one   This year the Leo Full Moon will be directly opposite Uranus in Aquarius. Some think that Aquarius and Leo are diametrically opposed to one another. But I find their synergistic and interdependent relationship unique among the signs. Aquarius demands radical change, which cannot be accomplished without Leo's talents: unwavering self-belief in one's personal vision and true leadership. Leo demands creativity and caring, which requires the Aquarian rejection of personal glorification in favor of global identification. When balanced, the Leo/Aquarius polarity works hand in hand to further the evolution of human civilization. Corruption, greed and suffering only exist when these energies lack equilibrium.  The Leo Full Moon assures us all that we have great personal power and we must learn to use it judiciously. This is the Full Moon to try on the role of leader. If you have wanted to come out front with your great ideas, this is the time to try. The connection with ego identity is strong on this Full Moon. Leo understands how much power it can wield, and will never shy away from using this knowledge to accomplish even the most outrageous goals. Forget the stereotypical Leo: a partygoer dancing with a lampshade on their head. Instead, think of showing up with a serious commitment to who you are and not backing down for anything. Leo is total self-belief and it uses total commitment to gain success and glory. Think of Madonna (Sun in Leo); she is a powerful presence who insists upon owning her vision and maintaining total control of the product. As we say in Silicon Valley, "it's all about believing your own marketing." Yes, of course there is a dark side to power and glory. We all know that an inflated ego creates the right conditions for abuses of power. But power used wisely can be of great benefit to all.   The beauty of Leo is how much it truly cares about others, and since this is a Full Moon, let's get into a celebratory space and bask in the light of Leo's positive qualities. This is the most dramatic, elegant and fun Full Moon of the year. So get out and enjoy the fireworks!    Source:   urlLink Astrowisdom

urlLink April 2003 Outlook from Moonsurfing.com   Dear Moonsurfers,  The Moon is New in Aries on Tuesday April 1st at 11:19 AM PST. Happy Lunar New Year!   Boy, oh boy, oh boy. Mars is closer to earth than it's been in 79,000 years!  The pressure to handle this planet's energy was never stronger. The high road for this energy is that of the sacred warrior while the low road reminds us that when colored with fear, assertion can become aggression. This New Moon in Aries brings you golden opportunities to redefine and redirect the way you use this personally assertive energy. Here's the cosmic context.  The Sun, Moon, and Mercury are partying in Aries, so blunt speech, as in speaking without thinking could make you the April Fool.  Use the quick-paced mental skills of Mercury's presence in Aries to think before you speak and come up with positive loving scenarios and brilliant win-win solutions. Channel your energy into positive avenues that support your self-confidence.  Get ready for a shot of growth and optimism as Jupiter turns direct on April 3rd after a retrograde period that started on Dec. 4th.  This gave you an opportunity to look at the things in your life that you don't want expanding.  Eliminate these with the help of Spirit as Jupiter movesforward and the spark you ignite with your intentions can grow  quickly.   Mars, the ruling planet of this Aries New Moon, currently travels through Capricorn and unites exactly with Chiron while squaring the Moon, Sun, Capricorn. What this means is that action will be taken and there will be some changes made. Use your energy efficiently and, when old wounds come up, remain open to alternative ways of dealing and healing.    This New Moon is a gift of enormous personal creative energy from the universe to use as you wish, so step forward boldly and courageously hand in hand and heart to heart with Spirit. Claim the adventure that is your life and make of it what you desire. Remember that old Chinese proverb that says, "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."                   Wishing you a Gloriously Creative New Moon,                                                            Claudia

Joseph Addison  The Taurus New Moon on May Day kicks off a powerful planetary boogie  that lasts all month long! This holiday celebrates Maia, the mother  goddess, and coincides with the New Moon in the first earth sign of the  zodiac, Taurus.  Deepen your connection with the material world through  your senses, your body, your possessions, and Mother Nature herself.   This is the first of two New Moons in May and the magic of new  beginnings, along with the pressure to take out the garbage, is seriously  amplified by the addition of two eclipses at the time of the Full Moon and  the 2nd New Moon. Be sure to sign up for the upcoming Telephone Seminar  during the Full Moon Phase on May 18th. You'll learn how to harness all  of these dynamic life-changing energies and have an opportunity to ask  me your questions.  As you take stock of resources and define security, and abundance for  yourself, you're building a base for your life to come. Earthly  practicalities must be tended to and here are the cosmic currents urging you  on.  A grand fixed cross squarely provides the kick-off and guarantees a  change in the physical status quo. The first leg is occupied by the Sun (Spirit shining through the  material world of resources), the Moon (emotional need for material grounding  and security), Mercury retrograde (encouraging slow, patient,  penetrating review of your consciousness regarding personal and planetary  resources), and Ceres (Goddess of the Earth encouraging you to nurture  yourself by communing and creating with nature)\85 all in Taurus.  The next leg is occupied by Jupiter in Leo on one side  (inviting an  enlightened basis for security and wealth), Neptune in Aquarius on the  other (targeting areas of collective confusion and deception and shifting  perceptions concerning our humanitarian dreams), and the last leg held  up by Juno in Scorpio (bringing opportunities to break through to new  levels of abundance through equitable sharing of power and resources).   This cosmic standoff can be used for great creativity and progress or  to produce deception and gluttony. Chiron, retrograde at 18 degrees  Capricorn, demands we know when less can be more, for the long-term good of  our personal and planetary health.           The challenge and gift of a Taurus Moon is unconditional self-love and  acceptance. Never underestimate the value of your greatest resource,  yourself in co-creatorship with Spirit. Getting clear about what and how  much you really need to thrive can help you eliminate excess stuff.  This helps you reclaim precious energy you'll need so you're able to take  advantage of the dynamic life-changing energies in store for you this  month.              Things don't happen easily or quickly now. Plant an intention to  strengthen your patience and maintain a positive focus.                   Claudia
CANCER LUNAR CYCLE  June 29 - July 27  from  urlLink http://www.moonsurfing.com/    The Cancer lunar cycle marks our entry into the 2nd quarter of the lunar year.   Tune into feelings and take decisive action to further your creative goals as the light and waxing energy increases.   Ideas and resources focused on in the first quarter of this lunar year will provide nourishment for the creative birthing that is to come.

Take advantage of opportunities to target and heal emotional stumbling blocks so you can manifest the reality you truly want.   Emotional and spiritual nourishment are emphasized. It's important that you manage this energy by taking care of your needs so they're not projected onto your relationships and the world at large.   Spend time at home to make it more comfortable and inviting for you and your family. Enjoy music, good food, relish your emotional connections, and soothe your soul with creative pursuits.

This is the climax to a very cosmically complex month.  Remember the importance of breathing fully and deeply. May 30th, or 31st  depending n your time zone, is the 2nd brand new beginning gifted to us by  the month of May and the accompanying solar eclipse provides us with  the opportunity to move forward in new directions, provided we've allowed  ourselves to process the feelings stirred up by the Full Moon lunar  eclipse.     Imagination and magic are heightened at the time of this New Moon ( the  2nd New Moon in one month is called a Black Moon in the Wiccan  tradition and denotes a time when magic/alchemy is extremely powerful.) A  sextile to this New Moon from Jupiter in Leo (expansion and broader  horizons) and Neptune in Aquarius (our field of dreams) sends a message telling  us that we can create what we can imagine.  Don't put too much on your  plate or you'll lose your focus and sacrifice much-needed clarity.  This eclipse may well pop information concerning the shady dealings of  Congress and the FCC concerning private and corporate media interests  in radio and television broadcasting. Freedom of speech and  communication is a basic tenet upon which this country was built, so stay aware of  what's happening and make those calls and write those letters. The  shift from Taurus (ruler of the throat) to Gemini within the month of May  reminds you to let your voice be heard.   On June 3rd, Saturn vacates Gemini after a 3-year stay and begins a  journey through Cancer that will last until July 16, 2005. Woman's issues  will be more prominent and the political, economic, and personal  lessons of the last 30 years come up for a reality check. (The first woman's  bank, the first woman to climb Mt. Everest, the first woman priests  ordained in the Anglican and Episcopalian churches, as well as Watergate,  worldwide inflation and the oil embargo/energy crisis marked the last  transit of Saturn through Cancer.)   Venus (ruler of Taurus, love, beauty and the way we attract what we  need on the material plane) and Mercury (the way we think and assimilate  information) are united in Taurus reminding us to connect heart and mind  to find win-win solutions. Stay positive, keep an open mind, cultivate  a willingness to listen, and tune into the adventurous excitement of  the new world that's opening up.     Remember that your consciousness creates, so reflect and  get ready to  co-create a new direction by committing your thoughts, feelings, words,  and actions to the universal mind of which we're all a part.

VIRGO LUNAR CYCLE  Aug 27 - Sep 24, 2003  The New Moon in Virgo on August 27 begins a 29.6-day cycle about developing  analytical skills , a  sense of discrimination  and the  ability to recognize patterns . This preparatory stage in the process of our development gives us time to improve our situation by attending to details. The simple rituals of daily life will provide the grounding necessary for balance. This is an especially good period to work on the mind-body connection.   Analyze and adjust daily routines to support physical and mental well being. Good health, altruistic service and productive employment support success; practicality and prudence guarantee it. Use this cycle to  refine  and  revise  the spark of intention you ignited last spring. It's time to redesign the form the future will take.   Mercury is Retrograde  from (Aug 28-Sept 20). Retrograde means redo, rethink, rewrite, revaluate, revisit, and reanalyze. Over the next three weeks we will have the opportunity to see what needs changing in work, health, finances, and life. Mercury loves to play hide-and-go-seek with every area of communication including, travel, cars, (traffic jams), computers, break downs, and lost items.  This creates an environment of whacky, crazy-making events and mishaps. Timing is everything! If you can wait, do not sign anything until after September 20th, your patience will pay off.   Mercury is the Messenger to the gods (archetypes).  He travels freely between worlds your conscious mind (the part of you reading this right now), and the subconscious (that which is just below the threshold of your awareness) i.e., dreams, true desires, wishes. And, the unconscious mind, the unknown part of Self made conscious through others, by mirroring back to us what is deeply hidden both light, and dark.    All of life is energy.  I am energy. You are energy. The personal and planetary astrology represents the energy patterns in motion we are currently utilizing (working with) consciously or unconsciously.  We live cycles within cycles.  With the Moon in Virgo and Jupiter the planet of wealth, blessings, gifts from the gods, and expansion, moving into Virgo also, where Jupiter will stay for the next year, we are invited to heal our health and advance our careers. Watch for making mountains(Jupiter) out of molehills (Virgo). We are building towards the fullmoon.  Plant your seeds (New Moon) and prepare for the harvest (Full Moon).         In this cycle of Virgo perfection, why not practice being  "unconditionally constructive"  that is no self-criticism or criticism of others, continuously focus on the positive, if we send out positive energy we will get back positive results, this is the Law of Attraction.  What is working in your life?  Instead of getting caught up in the negatives and fueling frustration, why not  express gratitude  for your blessings and practice the Law of Allowing.   Explore this Virgo cycle deeply and the secrets of financial/personal success.  Money is not the root of all-evil.  It is what we do with it!  We must evolve beyond the fear of money, sense of limitation, and struggle.  The power (global) elite are crumbling!  We the people are winning. As bad as things may seem, events are minuscule compared to what was seen (prophesized). We are moving into the light (energy) of the fifth dimension, a vibration of love, compassion and abundance.   Monthly Affirmation:  I serve the highest good through Love. I filter information without judgment. I find perfection in the moment.

LEO LUNAR CYCLE  July 28 - August 26 Interpretation by Maya del Mar from  urlLink http://www.daykeeperjournal.com   Leo is about expressing our selfhood, our personal centers, the heart of ourselves, that natural order within us which comes from spirit, and the expression of which gives our lives joy and drama and meaning. Leo is about integrity, nobility, honor, generosity, being true to the unfolding of ourselves and sharing that unfolding freely. In Cancer we created our personal, safe spot, our home port, our power place. Now in Leo we can grow in the garden which we\92ve created, and blossom there for all the world to see. Leo is associated with flower gardens, which capture the sun not for utility but for beauty\92s sake, simply to show off the splendors of life. On joyous and ceremonial occasions we give flowers, a symbol of sharing the divine love which we feel in our hearts.   Leo is a time when we have the power to bring new life energy from our deepest humanitarian resources into expression in our character and daily activities. Think of the Sun, endlessly radiating heat and light to the solar system. Now we can incorporate that great energy into our own centers. Leo leads to growth in our creative talents by strengthening both mind and will. Abstract thought is stimulated, as is power, confidence, and enthusiasm. Our receptivity to subtle forces and the powers of the imagination are also increased.   Self-mastery can take a giant leap during Leo time, leading to a new appreciation of our capabilities and an enhanced feeling of identity. Leo is also inspirational. Vacationing, traveling, enjoying and celebrating the beauties of creation are Leonian. The greatest expression of Leo is love\97the divine force which nurtures that which it has created. So now, during Leo time, let the love flow\97love of nature, love of ourselves, love of our fellow humans, and love of the omnipresent divine spark.  Bill Clinton is a very Leo type. Notice his lion\92s mane, his commanding presence, and the magnetic radiance which beams from him. He has created his own life and forged his own destiny with a strong sense of purpose, and in the process has inspired people around him, all Leo qualities. Carl Jung, with sun in Leo, broke from Freud and viewed the psyche as an evolving, growing center from which, like a mandala, life patterns radiate\97an expression of the sun within ourselves. Rosalynn Carter and Jacqueline Onassis are examples of Leo First Ladies. They both illustrate the natural dignity of Leo. Pride and arrogance can be Leo pitfalls."
urlLink SCORPIO LUNAR CYCLE  by Crystal Pomeroy Oct. 25 - Nov. 22 This Scorpio New Moon begins the lunar cycle marked by Samhain, Halloween (originally, Hallow\92s Mass), El D\EDa de los Muertos, and All Souls' Day\97the classic Scorpio festivities around the world. Prayerful reflection sets this lunation and the intense energies it entails off to a high-vibration start. It also gives us a chance to move into the year\92s end from a most constructive mental and spiritual position, especially with the very strong Saturn influences.  According to ancient pagan and neo-pagan tradition, the days preceding and marking mid-autumn are the high point of the year, a time at which many of life\92s most powerful aspects were traditionally celebrated. The current lunar cycle is most apt for resurrecting their energies, in a post-pagan world which tends to deny and repress the vital themes associated with the end of harvest, such as: change, death, Earth as our mother, the love that we feel towards her and towards those who have departed from the physical plane, and our individual power to  tap into transpersonal forces .  According to the ancient custom, the harvest-end festivities serve to thank the earth for her bounties, to thank Spirit, and to share both thanks and fruits with all loved ones, including those who have moved on from the material plane, honoring them personally in the realm of invisible life they now inhabit.  From these days forth, no fruit could be harvested until the following year, to give the earth a rest. On special, colorful altars or tables, places were set and food prepared and served for departed loved ones (and to this day, still are by Wikkans and Central Americans of native descent). At its heyday, this multi-dimensional, highly emotive holiday was a collective expression which underscored and fortified divine human nature, that higher potential whose scope is larger than mere consumption, physical survival and material appearances, capable of honoring and venerating all beings, including those (Mother Earth, disincarnate souls and other subtle entities) whose messages are audible to the spiritual (vs. merely physical) ear.  The race memory of this tradition, as well as the energies of the sky and earth themselves at this time, make of the Samhain New Moon a truly miraculous portal which anyone can access to  multiply blessings in all areas of personal and global existence , with prayers like the following, which can be included in a Samhain gathering or done privately, and which are adapted to current cultural terms and understanding:  strengthening tolerance at its deepest level, sending light to our departed loved ones, and invoking the amazing power of endings so available at this time, to annul whatever circumstances seem to have delayed successful consolidation of the passing year\92s goals . Stay tuned to our meditation for the Full Moon within this same cycle, designed to fill out our autumnal acts of inner power with visualizations which activate our mystical, feminine (in both men and women) power of attraction to magnetize whatever we need to finish our year\92s work, as we will also share a magical Full Moon offering to heal Mother Earth.  Before the actual altar and prayer suggestions, let\92s reflect on what this particular Samhain New Moon has to do with tolerance. In the first place, Wikkans especially focus on that virtue at this time, as they pay homage their predecessors who were burned at the stake by European churches. Furthermore, the intense Saturn stationary-retrograde which takes place right with this New Moon gives us a chance to effectively remake how we exercise our moral, and, as it is in Cancer, emotional, judgment nature. Metaphysically speaking, we have a chance to soften the punishing patriarch within,  informing our judgment nature with love , staying the mental hand that would condemn without previous, compassionate reflection.  Tolerance is a personal and global necessity. As remotely savage as the witch-burnings may seem, the danger of such extreme, thoughtless outbursts will lurk ever beneath the surface of our daily normalcy until we include careful, open-minded consideration, both compassionate and rational, in our a way of thought and life. Politically, such an approach can protect us from mass manipulation into rash, fundamentalist support of scapegoating, such as evidenced in Nazi Germany, the McCarthy witch-hunts, modern day treatment of Muslims, and the recent special elections in California.  The following principle is inscribed on the emerald tablet, "As above, so below." If you are still reading this by now, chances are you\92re among those who consider ourselves relatively tolerant. In such cases, prayer is a strong ally to pass from philosophic lenience to the ability to release emotional condemnation of those whose value systems diverge, even widely, from our own. Moral tolerance does not necessarily imply putting up with unacceptable conditions, but rather  staying free from the judgment trap , of sentencing those that differ from our most cherished tenets. Prayer for this intent can release us to the Power of Higher Love, which in turn will touch our personal realms, eventually influencing the larger communities of city, state, country and globe, lifting all levels up into a magical sphere of protection for the planet, for Spirit, for ourselves and for every visible and invisible being. This dimension of inner abundance will survive even when our outer forms, like the harvest\92s last fruits, are released unto Mother Earth.  Call on the Power of Endings to usher in a happy close to your passing year!  1) Make a list of those goals for work and other applied efforts you can remember having at the beginning of 2003.  2) On another page, briefly describe those activities, situations, behaviors, beliefs or attachments which you feel have kept you from consolidating those goals.  3) Call on the Angel of Endings, and ask her to assist you in accepting the demise of whatever situations would delay the consolidation of your divine plan for 2003. Then declare aloud, 13 times, as you visualize their meaning:  I CALL ON THE POWER OF ENDINGS WHICH IS NOW RENEWING THE EARTH, TO ELIMINATE ALL THAT WOULD DELAY THE CONSOLIDATION OF MY HIGHEST WORK. JUST AS LEAVES NOW FALL AWAY AND ARE DISSOLVED INTO THE EARTH, THOSE SITUATONS, ACTIVITIES, BELIEFS AND BEHAVIORS THAT NEED TO, NOW DROP FROM THE PANORAMA OF MY LIFE SO THAT MY HIGHEST ENDEAVORS MAY CONSOLIDATE AND PROSPER, QUICKLY AND IN PEACE.
urlLink LIBRA LUNAR CYCLE   Sept. 25 - Oct. 24, 2003 Fall is officially here and the waning half of the yearly lunar cycle begins! After perfecting and organizing the resources you developed over the last six months, you're ready to  share your creative and emotional harvest  with others.   This cycle emphasizes  balance  in all areas of your life. Adapt your health regimen to the seasonal change and be sure to include relaxation and meditation while allocating time for inward and outward activities.   Existing relationships, social interactions and new partnerships come to center stage. First strengthen your relationship with yourself by asking Spirit to help you in releasing old hurts and resentments so your personal wholeness is supported.   Collaboration and compromise provide win-win solutions to challenges confronting you, as long as you maintain your individual sense of balance. View yourself and the world with a loving heart, an open mind, and remember the underlying divine spark in others. Libra's ruler, Venus, emphasizes balance, beauty, grace, harmony, peace and love. These qualities are available right now and they begin within  you .  Interpretation by  urlLink Moonsurfing.com
urlLink SAGITTARIUS LUNAR CYCLE  by Claudia @ www.moonsurfing.com Nov. 23 - Dec. 22  It's time to lighten up, laugh and celebrate life.   Emotional stumbling blocks, outworn beliefs and areas calling for forgiveness are touched by powers of transformation as a total solar eclipse kicks off this lunar cycle.   Winter officially begins as the solstice occurs on Dec. 21st underscoring the shift towards the light. Following the deep emotional elimination process kicked off by the Harmonic Concordance eclipse set-up, ask yourself  what's true for you . Expand your viewpoint, cultivate a generous spirit and remember that your truth may not be everyone's truth. This cycle brings new opportunities and you're more aware of your place in the wider world now. Allow your life to tell a new story of possibilities, growth and fulfillment.   Sagittarius is the sign of risk-taking and expanding horizons. Perhaps the relinquishment of the outworn yet dearly held beliefs that form the very foundations of our lives is the biggest risk of all. Whatever you experienced on or around November 22, 1984 as well as May 21,1993 and May 25, 1994 provide clues as to what's being re-energized by this eclipse. Along with the broader awareness being popped by this eclipse, you can come into a greater love of self by  letting go of intolerance with yourself and your process.   We're flexing brand new muscles of perception. There's much wisdom to be gained as we open to new ideas and possibilities that are shifting and connecting us at the deepest levels of our souls.   Remember that old old phrase. "As you believe, so it is done unto you." It's time to reclaim your true power by reaffirming  the truth of who you really are.  Utilize the powerfully expansive energies of this Jupiter-ruled cycle and the ignition sparks provided by the New Moon Solar Eclipse set up to complete the surrender into your true identity as higher greater Self. Then walk that truth as you move toward your highest goals. All things are possible, if you believe.
urlLink CAPRICORN LUNAR CYCLE  by Claudia @ www.moonsurfing.com  Dec. 23 - Jan 20 The Capricorn lunar cycle reminds you that discipline is liberation. As the light returns, prepare to enter a year of love, relationship, responsibility, and healing under the vibration of the number "6". Heed the call to consolidate your resources, set new limits and goals, and be more self-reliant.   Mercury continues to move in retrograde motion till January 6th.  Reflect on the lessons you've learned and get clear about where you need to set new limits and boundaries so you can accomplish your goals.  Think out of the box for alternative solutions to areas calling for healing.   As the month progresses, strike a balance between your desires for status and achievement in the outer world with time spent attending to family, feelings, and rest and renewal of body and soul. Utilize challenging situations to decide what needs to change. Then make a comprehensive plan and remember that patience, persistence and preparation are valuable resources.   Last month's lunar energy encouraged you to set off with providential trust, hope, and a belief in good fortune. This month's energy requires that you  align with your highest intentions and diligently prepare for your journey leaving nothing to chance .
urlLink AQUARIUS LUNAR CYCLE  by Kelley Rosano Jan 20 - Feb 19  The Sun Soars into Aquarius on January 20, 2004 and we have both the Sun and the New Moon in Aquarius the next day on January 21st.   Now is the time to plant the seeds of what you desire to harvest in your life, work, and relationships.  If we have been too serious and focused on work, perhaps we need to invite play back into our lives.  Aquarian energy fires lightning truth, unexpected events, and upsets into the status quo to keep life from getting too rigid, constricting, or comfortable.   Shaking and waking us up to experience new ways of living, being and loving.      Aquarius invites us into fresh starts, new roads, boldness, genius, and group membership.  Wild man Uranus is the ruling planet of Aquarius, he is outrageous, shocking, and erratic.  Uranus loves to create chaos, and upset for that which is out dated, out grown or boorishly stuck.  We will continue to experience a breakdown in paradigms, institutions, and organizations that are in truth obsolete.  The light is oncoming and the Age of Aquarius is dawning.  Uranus is in the spiritual sign Pisces for the next eight years, erasing boundaries between the spiritual and physical worlds, technology will boom with space age inventions.  Your intuitve and psychic abilities will continue to grow.  Pay attention to your dreams they are filled with life directing knowledge. Where do you need more freedom?     On a planetary level, we are closing out the Piscean Age, and ending a 26,000-year cycle.  We are now entering the Age of Aquarius and starting a new 26,000 year cycle.    In truth, we live cycles within cycles, Pisces (last two thousand years) into Aquarius (next two thousand years.) The Age of Aquarius is the promised coming revolution in higher consciousness, an age of peace, truth, beauty, freedom, and love. Where competition is replaced with cooperation.   Today is the time to prepare for higher consciousness by practicing Self-love and acceptance.  The paramount mission, individually, may be for the development of a healthy foundation with Self and Spirit. 'Self' is the inner essence, soul identity and authenticity of each individual.  When we are in alignment with Self, we base our choices upon one's true values and personal integrity, and enjoy a certain level of completion, joy, flow, and wholeness.    As individuals come into a greater sense of Self and Spirit, they assist in raising the consciousness of the planet, as  well as themselves.   When our cup is full, we are available to assist others.  This lifetime offers a grand opportunity to live in a new level of awareness, authenticity and happiness.  We are the seedlings of the Aquarian Age, the forerunners plowing the way for greater souls of light to embody with us and take us to Greatest Party we have experienced in thousands of years, the Golden Age of Aquarius.
urlLink Pisces Lunar Cycle  by Ronni Lynn Feb 20 - March 20  This month the New Moon will be in the sign of Pisces. Pisces is a most mystical sign because it deals with the unconscious side of life and ourselves.  Pisces' influence dissolves boundaries- those barriers that separate people and even nations from understanding each other.  When boundaries are lifted we experience compassion, true understanding and a gentleness toward ourselves and each other. In order to accomplish this we must first deal with dissolving those boundaries within ourselves. By this I mean the differences between our external selves (how we act, dress, what we say we believe, etc) with our internal selves- who we truly are. When we are free to reflect to the outside who we really are then we will experience increased authenticity. With this authenticity we will begin to experience true connections with others. After all, if we are being a true reflection of ourselves, it will be our truth that others will be responding to. What a wonderful foundation for any relationship! When people who are being true to themselves interact, when their internal, and/or subconscious self is reflected outwardly, barriers between them will melt because they will have an understanding of each other. We all have much more in common than we realise or would like to admit. With this in mind, this is a good time to forgive others who have wronged us, ask forgiveness, or to forgive ourselves for past failures.   A good way to find your inner truth is to quiet your mind, to meditate and just observe what comes up. Sometimes defense mechanisms that may have served us at the time of a traumatic experience persist and only serve to block our true energies from arising. You can sometimes tell that this is happening when you no longer allow yourself to feel vulnerable emotionally with others. This is a time when as we relax our minds and bodies we learn to release those tensions that block our emotional response with others. Pisces rules higher ideals, dreams and inspirations.  Let your imagination and creativity expand during this time.  We can wish to increase our spiritual awareness, our surrender to and faith in a higher power, or to find the correct spiritual path or teacher. At this time perhaps we can come to a realization that everything has a purpose, we are all connected, and that there is a perfect order to the universe. We are all part of the unfolding of that universe. This is a good month to wish for a decrease in feeling like a victim, or in feeling helpless or out of control. These are Pisces qualities that can go overboard. We need to  curb a tendency for complete escapism , such as overuse of alcohal or drug abuse. While fantasy and inspiration can work to help us develop into more evolved beings, to expand our possibilities, we can also  learn to distinguish fantasy from reality, truth from fiction . We must avoid the tendency to deceive ourselves and others with escapism. Pisces energy helps us dream, and offers us the opportunity to use that dream to make the world a better place for everyone. Neptune's energy can be harnessed to increase our creativity and creative expression in art, writing, dance, drama, or music.  Dreams and inspiration are the first steps before action.    The next sign, Aries will take the actions that follow the dreams that Pisces created. Pisces is the last sign of the Zodiac and with the dreams of Pisces feeding unconsciously into the energies of the first sign of the Zodiac, Aries, the cycle is again complete. The next new moon will be in Aries on March 20, 2004 at 5:42 PM. E.S.T. Come visit me then or a few days before for more New Moon reflections.   With Blessings- Ronni
urlLink ARIES LUNAR CYCLE  by Claudia @ www.moonsurfing.com  March 20 - April 18  In true Aries style, this is a highly active lunar month of bold energy wherein we move forward on our personal ideas and desires. The equinox occurs just hours before the New Moon. This emphasizes the cycle's underlying theme of  balance  and brings us into the First Quarter of the lunar year... a major turning point. Daylight savings time occurs on April 4th further underscoring the shift towards  more and more light .   Last month you grounded yourself by strengthening your spiritual connection, getting in touch with your dreams and reaching for a higher love. Remember to utilize the warrior energy of Aries in a most sacred way as you  take action to manifest those qualities and dreams .   A 3-week Mercury Retrograde period begins on April 6th bringing you an opportunity to take care of unfinished business as you prepare to move full tilt boogie in new directions. The combination of planetary energies reminds you to  temper your ideas with patience, persistence and prudence  as you pursue lasting goals and values. Don't energize negativity, but  hone your intent and harness your will  in the most positive ways as you blast off into the fresh start of a most promising spring.
urlLink TAURUS LUNAR CYCLE  by Dana Gerhardt @  urlLink http://www.mooncircles.com   April 19 - May 20  This New Moon brings a partial Solar Eclipse. Eclipses bring a dramatic acceleration or sudden turn of events. What has recently changed for you? Eclipses force much needed changes to the surface. Their shakedown makes it easier to release worn-out behaviors, attitudes and relationships. Their  turbulence impels us to grow .    This New Moon is particularly potent. It is the second New Moon in Aries this year. Was\97at the Aries New Moon last month\97your inner heroic nature roused to action? You may have found that what was stagnant in your life was becoming unbearable. Spring is about initiating action. Leaves suddenly fill out bare branches. Hyacinth and tulip bulbs shoot up from the ground.  Where have you been springing forth?  This is the second cycle of Artemis\97goddess of the Moon and goddess of the hunt. She is summoned in each of us this season, expressed in our joyous independence, in our nurturing and courageous action.   Perhaps the most important resolve you might make this New Moon is to shift your focus from what you don\92t want\97on to what you do.  Your future will be created by what you place your mind on now.  If you\92re focused on irritations or lack, you will get more of the same. If you fill your heart with winning feelings, if you  fill your mind with images of success , the momentum towards a brighter future will build. Negative energy only brings more negativity. The tulip bulb shooting up from the earth doesn\92t think "I don\92t want more winter." It is thinking "I want to be a luscious bloom." When you do likewise this cycle, a resplendent future will be speeding your way.
urlLink GEMINI LUNAR CYCLE : By Rev. Pauline Southard  This month's lunar cycle has an overall scattered feeling especially after May 21, 2004 when the Sun leaves Taurus for light and mutable Gemini. We feel we are jumping from one thing to another. Taking even just a few minutes to regroup will truly help this month. The New Moon of May 19, 2004 arrives at 12:51 AM EDT. This is the last gasp of the very fixed Taurus energy we experienced during the last lunar cycle. This New Moon lies at the very bottom of the chart, beckoning us to plant our spring gardens and attend to matters around the house. We could really use a little time out from work. A household crisis requires that we scramble to manipulate our schedules.  Our committed love relationships are smooth sailing now. Sexual intimacy provides us with a wonderful nurturing connection that lasts long after the physical act is completed. Truly a meeting of souls.   This part of the lunar cycle provides us with great potential to plan our summer vacations and those of the children we are responsible for. A sibling conveys some good advice concerning matters of the heart and/or financial affairs.   The First Quarter Moon of May 27, 2004 at 3:56 AM EDT starts its work while we are still dreaming. The Sun has now entered Gemini. Gemini energy in its pure form is all about communication, inquisitiveness and love of socializing. At its best, its clever wit can cause us to look at matters from a different perspective while laughing. When this energy is used negatively, it can denote lack of focus, the facile & easy answer over the deeper and more thoughtful approach and a disregard for other\92s feelings.   Expect some unexpected expenses that may impede our goals in the short term. However, towards the end of the First Quarter Moon, we find that our partners are particularly helpful in very practical and substantial ways.  The Full Moon of June 3, 2004 at 12:19 AM EDT makes everything appear larger than life as the Sun and Moon depart from a square to Jupiter. Relax! Although we feel that we must do it all perfectly, perhaps an adequate job will suffice without totally stressing us out. Any recent tensions in our relationships ease now. It could be fun to see a play or an unusual foreign movie now.  The Third Quarter Moon of June 9, 2004 at 4:02 PM EDT heightens our emotional sensitivity. We are particularly adept at tuning into our lover\92s and children\92s feelings. A great time to go to the beach and paint! Or we could single mindedly pursue projects that have seemed to have had a missing element until now and complete them. It is a great week for a trip with a lover- either an inner or literal journey would be wonderful now.
Lunar Energy: Full Moon Rituals   The moon has always played an important part in ancient spiritual practices. Since the beginning of time, people have recognized lunar power, which is where the term, "lunacy" comes from. Even today there is much speculation as to the affects of the moon's phases, particularly the full moon, on our moods and behavior. The belief behind full moon rituals is to harness lunar power to the benefit of oneself and others. Ceremonies performed at this phase of the moon are meant for empowerment, as well to manifest positive changes.   The full moon appears once every 29.53 days, therefore rituals can be performed almost every month, sometimes even twice a month. And, you need not be outside or even see the full moon to reap its powerful benefits. There are many full moon rituals, some more complex than others, involving magical tools and enhancements. Yet, many are quite simple, including a moon bask which is just that, basking in the full moonlight and meditating. You can do the ritual standing, sitting, or laying on the ground, or even indoors if it's more practical. Just stand by a large window, open if possible, and meditate on that which would enhance your life.   One well-known ceremony is "Drawing Down the Moon," to connect with the power and wisdom of the full moon. In Wicca traditions, a priestess performs the ceremony in order for her to become the living embodiment of the mood goddess. There are also rituals where all participants "draw down the moon" to evoke the deity of the moon within themselves. For a healing ritual, Selena Fox, of the Circle Craft tradition, offers this Moon Mirror Healing. Place a silvered mirror face up on an altar or sacred place so that the light of the full moon shines upon it. Place a symbol to represent the one seeking healing in the center of the mirror. The symbol may be a photo, piece of jewelry, lock of hair, or simply a name on a card. Use the symbol on the mirror in the moonlight as a focal point as you imagine that the one needing healing is becoming well and then healthy. After the ritual, deliver the symbol to the subject of the healing rite as an additional way of transmitting healing. Cleanse the mirror you used by washing it with a mugwort solution or passing it through the smoke from mugwort or another incense. In this way, the mirror will be ready for use for another healing.   Whether you perform simple or elaborate full moon rituals, or just enjoy the beauty of the full moon, you're participating in a long tradition of showing appreciation for a powerful source of illumination.

From: KnowledgeNews  info@knowledgenews.net >  Prepare to be mooned--blue mooned.  This Saturday, July 31, a "blue moon" rises.  Of course, you probably won't see even a hint of blue color, just your average full moon. So what gives? What's so blue about a moon that isn't? Heck, astronomers even say that blue moons aren't rare. And folklorists say they're not what everyone thinks they are.  As any budding astronomer can tell you, a "blue moon" is the second full moon in a calendar month. It isn't really blue. It's just a name. But why, of all things, do we call a white moon "blue" Actually, there are truly blue moons.   In 1883, an Indonesian volcano erupted with the force of a 100-megaton nuclear bomb. With a roar heard nearly 400 miles (over 600 kilometers) away, Mount Krakatoa belched a column of volcanic gas and ash into the atmosphere. That night, the moon rose blue over Indonesia. Particles from Krakatoa's ash, not more than a micron wide, made it happen. These micron-wide particles were exactly the right size to scatter red light, while allowing other colors, such as blue, to pass. The result: a blue sphere hanging in the sky. Different sized particles filtered other colors and caused different effects. In fact, for several years after the eruption, there were reports fro mall over the globe of red moons, green moons, and, yes, even more blue moons..   What's more, some of the sunsets following the eruption were such a blazing red that people actually called on firemen to drown the optical illusion.. The eruptions of Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo produced the same anomaly.&nbsp; So have forest fires.&nbsp;Still, none of this explains why we call the second full moon in a month a blue moon. The phrase is old, even if the modern meaning is not. Before Shakespeare penned a word of Hamlet, the English knew little couplets like: If they say the moon is blewe, we must believe that it is true.

urlLink CANCER LUNAR CYCLE  by Maya del Mar&nbsp; July 17 -&nbsp;August 16   During the passage of the sun through Cancer we are  extraordinarily open to our inner selves , to our own depths, to our own connections with the universe. The vulnerability of this state increases our need for security, and we find ourselves attending to those aspects of our lives which center in our own hearth\97our inner child, our family, our domestic lives, our homes, our businesses\97those things which relate to creating a stable base, those situations in which we find  safety and comfort .   The Sun enters the sign of Cancer at Summer Solstice. This is the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. At that moment the days begin to shorten, the night force takes over, and we begin our six-month journey of gradually embracing the darkness, which climaxes at winter solstice on December 21.   Like the night to which she introduces us,  the forces of Cancer are mysterious . They are ruled by the Moon, the Goddess of the Night, who brings her waxing and waning lanterns to guide us through the dark, through the murky unconscious, through the watery depths of feeling.   In Gemini we made connections with every passing event, as we restlessly kept ourselves in motion, learning about the world, exploring. Now in Cancer it is time to center ourselves, to  turn within  and learn who we are and what we need, to nurture our inner child and create a safe home for it. The darkness of the subconscious is our real staging ground for life, and we must develop lines of support to anchor ourselves to its vastness, while at the same time maintaining fluid passageways for growth, for change, and for movement to new levels.   In Aries, we brought the seed of spirit to earth, in Taurus we multiplied the seeds, in Gemini the air swept them up to disperse them, and now in Cancer each seed will  find its proper spot in which to put down strong roots .   It is most appropriate that we plant our gardens by the moon, which rules Cancer. The moon fluctuates within its monthly cycle, and also is connected with the daily fluctuations of tidal waters throughout the world. Underlying this fluctuation, which may seem capricious if we don\92t pay attention to life\92s rhythms, there are regular cycles and predictability. The energy of Cancer, similarly, is a fluctuating movement\97going within to deep sources and then moving out to express those depths in the world, ever shifting as do the ocean currents. But like the moon Cancer has its inner predictability, and is accountable to its own rhythms.   Cancer rules containers of all kinds, including the womb, where young life is nourished, and the home, where families are nourished. It rules gestation, that vulnerable time when an embryo is being formed deep within layers of protection.   Cancer is associated with bodies of fluid, such as lakes and amniotic sacs. It knows. It knows that water, which symbolizes emotions in astrology, is the essential matrix of life, and that feelings are tender and vulnerable and must be protected, just as the growing fetus must be protected. It knows intimately about growth, because it carries the growth process within itself. And growth, too, must be protected and attended to so that the fledgling is strong and healthy. &nbsp; The Sabian Symbol for 26 Cancer is:   "GUESTS ARE READING IN THE LIBRARY OF A LUXURIOUS HOME. The transference of social privilege to the level of intellectual enjoyment. We see the concretization of cultural excellence and wealth at the level at which individuals can exercise their developmental capacities in comfort. The process is individualized because the library belongs to a private residence, the luxury of which implies an individual\92s concentration upon the acquisition of wealth. Maintaining CLASS STANDARDS OF INFORMATION. What is at stake here is the need to conform to the requirements of one\92s social status." &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Dining Room  Dining tables should not be placed in front of the main door.  A dining table that faces the toilet receives too much Yin and can negatively affect health.  A dining table should not be used as partition between two rooms.  If a dining table faces the kitchen or is in the kitchen area, it receives too much Yang and the diners might develop a bad temperament.  Air conditioning, central heating and fans are best kept on the left side of the dining room.

On the closet?
"Bathrooms, hallway corners, laundry rooms, even open closets work well. Make sure your kitten can get inthe box easily; she may not be able to climb into the bathtub or over the high rim of a tall box.   One important piece of advice: Once you've decided on a spot, don't change it unless you are confident that boxes in other locations are already begin used frequently. Finally, keep track of which box is most popular -- you might be better off offering two in that spot, and foregoing the basement box that is visited only rarely."
Do not use a beater bar vac by all means. Even if the bristles are soft, it only takes one paperclip to get caught up in it to really mess up your floors. As far as wheels go, best not to do that either. No, I don't expect the appliance to float above the floor mysteriously, but a damaged plastic or a metal wheel can cause considerable damage in a short amount of time.   Expect higher maintainence on wood floors than carpet and expect to clean it more often. Carpet acts as a filter and absorbs dust and dirt. Wood can't. I have dark stained red oak (finish is tung oil) wood flooring thru out my home and have always used my dust mop (sometimes lightly mist dust mop with water) with my dustpan, then mop with warm water which mop is wrung out till almost dry/damp and then mop my floor. My mother lives in her old family home which was built in the 1870s and she always used a dust mop and never used a vacuum and her floors are beautiful!   Another good workable and cheap solution.... a small shop vac. I bought the 2Gal/2.0 HP sized one at Lowes for $29 and it sucks up everything (including the drapes). Also, for quick cleanups of pet hair balls and the like, I use the dry swifter mop.

Thank you for your inquiry regarding natural gas service---  It sounds as if you are familiar with gas appliances so I'll address the last part of your correspondence first---We do have an allowance of $50 for gas dryers if converting from electric to gas---However, this allowance does require that you have an existing gas water heater or install a gas water heater at the same time the dryer is installed (the latter would qualify you for an additional allowance)---For details please see our allowances and requirements which are also on our web site---  As you are probably aware, natural gas appliances are generally more cost effective (operationally) than comparable electric models, especially when combined with multiple pieces of gas equipment---  For information regarding the efficiency ratings of specific washers and dryers, please contact Amy Carpus in our Conservation Services Department @ 393-1450 with the make and model #'s of the units you are interested in and she will be able to assist you---  Thank you again for your inquiry and for using our online service---If you have additional questions regarding natural gas, please do not hesitate to contact me---  Mike Brown Gainesville Regional Utilities

urlLink Whirlpool Resource Saver Washer  The innovative Whirlpool Resource Saver® Washer saves up to 47% of the water needed to clean clothes, while using only 56% of the energy*. This could save you up to $100 per year.   urlLink Senseon Dryer  The Senseon™ Drying System uses a thermistor and moisture-sensing strips, coupled with computer controls, to continually measure temperature and moisture to determine the load type and rate of drying. When clothes reach "damp dry", the dryer already "knows" how long it will take them to be completely dry because it knows the types of clothes being dried (whether they're heavy or light) and how long it took them to reach the damp dry point. This accuracy helps prevent overdrying and shortens cycle times by up to 20 minutes.
urlLink By Brian Ogan, Designer : Accentuate tall, open spaces. Don't clutter walls with small pieces of art. A favorite tactic is to fill a large pot with river rocks and arrange tall bamboo stems that fan out and reach to the ceiling. An interesting sculpture also works well.   Warm up a wall. Paint a single wall in a soft sage or a warm wine. This adds a welcome touch of color and warmth.   Get smart about storage. Carefully plan every piece of furniture to control clutter. Open shelving is also a good option, because it keeps the wall exposed and maintains the open feeling of the room.    Use lighting as art.  Simple, modern wall sconces are attractive and provide soft illumination without using up valuable surface space.    Use area rugs as anchors. Area rugs help break down a loft space into separate living areas, without sacrificing overall openness. They also warm up bare floors and help reduce echoes.   Maintain open space. Arrange furniture so it does not block views to windows and doors. Modern benches, stools, and ottomans are great because their simple, clean lines don't obstruct views and minimize the feel of a small room. Coffee tables and lamp tables with clear glass will give you extra surface space but won't make a room look cluttered. Avoid overstuffed sofas and chairs.

Don't block traffic flow with furniture. Some good rules to follow:  Allow three feet for pathways in and out of a room.   Chairs and sofas should be no more than eight feet apart (too much distance makes conversation difficult).  Keep about 18 inches between the sofa and coffee table.

urlLink Storage Ideas :  A large garbage can may be covered with a round plywood top, draped with a round skirt and pronto -- storage for a variety of household items.  Ladders or step stools topped with shelves or a flush door table top provide storage space, display area, desk or work surface.  Adding legs and cushions to a door or other flat board makes a bench, bed or sofa. Casters may also be used in place of legs. Without the cushions, you have a movable plant stand to display collections, books or records.  Bricks (stone, concrete or glass) and boards can be used for bookshelves, shoe shelves, end tables, coffee tables and plant stands.  Use five-sided cubes for a number of things. A basic 15-inch cube made of plywood can be a coffee table, an end table, a storage unit, a cushioned seat or almost anything you like, and in any color because it is easy to paint or enamel. Brightly painted cubes lined up along the floor of a child's room will hold books and toys. Stack them up in your family room to hold books, small TV, stereo equipment, and decorative objects. Stacked units can be used for a two-faced room divider with open sides facing either way.  Storage containers can be made from boxes, tin cans, baskets or other recycled containers. These can be painted, covered with self-adhesive paper, wallpaper, fabric. Sturdy old tables, chests or storage units can look attractive through refinishing, painting, application of self-adhesive paper or upholstering with easily-cared-for fabric.   New or used filing cabinets may be used in a variety of ways to provide an abundance of storage. Cover them with fabric, wallpaper or a coat of paint to make them more attractive.

urlLink Energy Efficiency
urlLink Energy Efficiency & Environmental News: Lighting :   There are many cost effective strategies and technologies available for slashing lighting energy use. As Barney Capehart says; 'If everyone went to the store today and bought high efficiency products or devices for their homes, offices, and factories, Florida could cut its energy use in half.'  Daylighting through skylights and windows can be economical. Only indirect light generates less heat than electric lamps. Skylights can be modified with white paint, lenses, or reflective film to reduce solar heat gain.  Incandescent lamps are the most widely used, and the least efficient. Low pressure sodium vapor lamps, one of the most efficient light sources, uses 9 times less electricity for the same brightness, produce less heat, and lasts 18 times as long as incandescent lamps. Sodium lamp light, however, does not render color naturally.
urlLink Clothes Dryers :  The most efficient method of drying clothes is to employ the solar powered clothes dryer; that is, a line strung up between two posts or trees. When dried in the sun, clothes smell fresher and look cleaner. If a mechanical clothes dryer is selected, pay attention to the yellow efficiency labels. &nbsp; In general, appliances using heat such as water heaters, space heaters, clothes dryers and cooking appliances are more efficient if they use natural gas rather than electricity or liquid petroleum gas. Natural gas normally provides: a wider variety of temperature settings, instantaneous on/off heat, is more environmentally benign, and is more economical - the energy cost is usually half the cost of electricity.
urlLink Washing Machines : Washing machines should have at least three water level selections - high, medium and low; and provide for washing in cold, warm and hot water and rinsing in cold water. Other features should be selected on the type of washing that is expected. Some of these include delicate and permanent press cycles. In general, washing in warm water is the most energy efficient method; cold water washing usually requires a longer cycle or more detergent to wash the clothes to the same degree of cleanliness. Using the proper water level to fit the load is probably the most important energy saving consideration when operating a washing machine."

But he gave no exact timeframe for resuming dialogue in the city, where fierce three-day battles this week between the NLA and government troops ruined a 15-day truce. One civilian was shot dead there on Thursday, local police said, but no details were immediately available. ``Tetovo is a kind of melting pot for Macedonia. We are going to Tetovo to defend all those achievements,'' Trajkovski said in a reference to the previous round of talks, which had made some progress but stalled over whether Albanian should become an official language in some parts of Macedonia. The West has taken a lead role in trying to prevent a five-month-old ethnic Albanian rebellion in Macedonia from becoming another Balkan war.

Eugene Polzik and his colleagues at the University of Aarhus are not about to beam anyone up to the Starship Enterprise, but their research reported in the science journal Nature on Wednesday makes the idea of instantly transporting an object from one place to another less far fetched.  It involves quantum entanglement -- a mysterious concept of entwining two or more particles without physical contact. Albert Einstein once described it as ``spooky action at a distance.''

urlLink September 11, 2001   September 11 2001, the tone of America changed.  The news was relentless and none of it was good. Words conveyed the events but words failed to tell the emotional tale. As NPR covered the events, it was music that gave listeners time to reflect, to digest the images and the impact. So many letters came to NPR telling us how comforted they were by the music. In the wake of all that happened I was surprised anyone would take the time to mention the music; it seemed so trivial compared to the weeks' events. I was reminded again why composers score and why players perform. Together they create a magnificence that goes beyond the spoken word, both touching the ear and reaching the soul.   I've put together some of that music here, in part to answer some of those letters wondering what we played (precise record keeping was impossible), and also to create an aural snapshot that in some small way tries to capture the tone of a nation shaken and changed.  I hope you find comfort in this edition of All Songs Considered.  Bob Boilen Director All Things Considered

Food and Agriculture Organization (news - web sites) (FAO) have become extinct. Latest information suggests that 30 percent of the world's farm animal breeds are at risk of disappearing, and their valuable traits, such as their ability to adapt to harsh conditions, disease, drought and poor quality feed, could be lost too. ``Once you lose a genetic resource, it's gone forever,'' said Ricardo Cardellino, the FAO's senior officer for animal genetic resources. ``We don't know what we will need in future in terms of genetic resources.''
urlLink Researchers have begun to explain how emotional reactions and logical thinking interact in moral decision-making  Princeton University researchers reported in the Sept. 14 issue of Science that they used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to analyze brain activity in people who were asked to ponder a range of moral dilemmas.  The results suggest that, while people regularly reach the same conclusions when faced with uncomfortable moral choices, their answers often do not grow out of the reasoned application of general moral principles. Instead, they draw on emotional reactions, particularly for certain kinds of moral dilemmas.  The results also show how tools of neuroscience are beginning to reveal the biological underpinnings of the subtlest elements of human behavior, said Joshua Greene, a graduate student in philosophy who conducted the study in collaboration with scientists in the psychology department and the Center for the Study of Brain, Mind and Behavior.  "We think of moral judgments as so ethereal," said Greene. "Now we're in a position to start looking at brain anatomy and understanding how neural mechanisms produce patterns in our behavior."  The study focused on a classic set of problems that have fascinated moral philosophers for years because of the difficulty in identifying moral principles that agree with the way people react.  One dilemma, known as the trolley problem, involves a runaway train t

Golos of the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, described the successful insertion of a "reporter gene" into two fertilized rhesus macaque embryos. The gene, which causes jellyfish cells to produce a robust green glow, likewise conferred this activity on the placental cells where it was found.

urlLink World Reacts with Revulsion to U.S. Attacks  LONDON (Reuters) - World leaders reacted with revulsion on Tuesday to what President George Bush called an ``apparent terrorist attack'' by aircraft that crashed into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon (news - web sites) in Washington. But amid the global horror, Palestinian gunmen at refugee camps in Lebanon fired into the air on Tuesday to celebrate the news of the attacks. ``America and Israel are one. This is the result of American policy,'' one Palestinian gunman said. No one had yet claimed responsibility. Lebanese, Palestinian and Israeli leaders joined Europe, Mexico and other countries in condemning the devastating attacks that caused as yet unknown casualties. Western European leaders broke off their normal business to return to their capitals for crisis meetings and expressed solidarity with the United States. From every corner of Europe, leaders condemned attacks they branded horrendous, abominable, disgusting, monstrous and abhorrent. The European Union (news - web sites) said it was the worst attack on America since Pearl Harbor 60 years ago and was ``one of those few days in life that one can actually say will change everything.'' ``This is an act of war by madmen,'' EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten told Reuters.

INTERNET ACCESS THROUGH POWER LINES? THEY'RE WORKING ON IT Might you one day connect to the Internet via the nearest wall socket? It's possible -- technically, anyway. The mission of the newly minted joint-venture company Linecom Inc. will be to develop and deploy "power line communication" systems in Japan, which would push Internet access onto existing power lines.  Formed among Kansai Electric Power Co. and Matsushita Electric Works Ltd. in Japan and Israel's Itran Communications, the new company will capitalize on Kansai Electric's knowledge of power-distribution systems, Itran's power line communication (PLC) technology and Matsushita's expertise in system integration and product design to develop a complete, start-to-finish solution, from modems to power-line networking equipment. Itran has developed a special modem that links to the Internet via household electrical outlets. Power company Kansai Electric intends to launch the service once the the Japanese government deregulates the use of high-frequency bands for PLC, which is expected to happen early next year.

urlLink Coincidences: Remarkable or Random? (Skeptical Inquirer)   "You don't believe in telepathy?" My friend, a sober professional, looked askance. "Do you?" I replied. "Of course. So many times I've been out for the evening and suddenly became worried about the kids. Upon calling home, I've learned one is sick, hurt himself, or having nightmares. How else can you explain it?"  Such episodes have happened to us all and it's common to hear the words, "It couldn't be just coincidence." Today the explanation many people reach for involves mental telepathy or psychic stirrings. But should we leap so readily into the arms of a mystic realm? Could such events result from coincidence after all?  There are two features of coincidences not well known among the public. First, we tend to overlook the powerful reinforcement of coincidences, both waking and in dreams, in our memories. Non-coincidental events do not register in our memories with nearly the same intensity. Second, we fail to realize the extent to which highly improbable events occur daily to everyone. It is not possible to estimate all the probabilities of many paired events that occur in our daily lives. We often tend to assign coincidences a lesser probability than they deserve.   However, it is possible to calculate the probabilities of some seemingly improbable events with precision. These examples provide clues as to how our expectations fail to agree with reality.

urlLink The journalism and films of John Pilger  On 2 August 1990 the Iraqi army invaded its southern neighbour, Kuwait. Four days later the United Nations responded by imposing a complete trade embargo on Iraq. In the ten years since Iraq has continued to be the subject of sanctions that affect almost every aspect of life for the average woman, man and child.   With imports of food and medicine severely restricted, malnutrition and disease is now endemic in what was once one of the healthiest countries in the world. A 1999 Unicef report calculated that more than half a million children had died as a direct result of sanctions. On average 200 hundred Iraqi children are dying every day.   In September 1998, Denis Halliday head of the UN humanitarian programme in Iraq resigned claiming he could no longer administer 'an immoral and illegal' policy. His successor, Hans von Sponeck also later resigned, along with the head of the World Food Programme.   Meanwhile US and UK politicians insist that the sanctions regime is necessary to contain the threat of Saddam Hussein. When asked on US television whether the death of 500,000 Iraqi children as a result of sanctions was justified Madelaine Albright replied 'I think this is a very hard choice, but the price - we think the price is worth it.'

Bees invade the internet   By BBC News Online internet reporter Mark Ward  Soon software that acts like bees or ants could be running the internet.   Researchers at the University of California are claiming that we need radically new ways to run the net as more and more people and devices go online.   Michael Wang and Tatsuya Suda say that existing methods of keeping the net going will not be able to cope when billions of people, mobile phones, hand-held computers and household appliances are routinely using it to communicate.   What is needed, claim the pair, are self-organising systems inspired by biology.   The researchers are experimenting with discrete programs called agents that have been modelled on bees and ants.   Individually these insects are very stupid but put enough of them together and they do a very efficient job of running and maintaining huge structures like nests and hives without any central control.   By contrast, current internet management systems tend to be very centralised and directed by people.   Mr Wang says that this set-up will be unable to cope when everything from our PCs to refrigerators is online.   No-one will have the time or inclination to ensure that all the devices are doing what they should, he says.   "The devices should just self-manage or self-organise and just do the right things," says Mr Wang.   Many popular web events already struggle to serve all the people that want to see them.   When Sir Paul McCartney did a webcast of a performance at the Cavern in Liverpool, servers were overwhelmed by the numbers wanting to watch the show.   Under the scheme proposed by the US researchers, as a website increases in popularity the content on it, be it a video or audio stream, will be copied and ferried to websites closer to the people trying to see or hear it.   Mr Wang says that the user requests are like food and the small software programs that ferry the content across are like bees blazing a trail to the source. The bees "die" when users stop requesting clips.   Belgian scientist Marco Dorigo is looking at using small, stupid, ant-like programs to improve the running of the internet. But he is proposing to let the ants run the infrastructure of the net rather than just serve up video clips to people.   The bee-like software entities are programmed with a few simple rules that define what they do.   This rule-based approach is also being used to recreate huge battle scenes for the Lord of the Rings movie currently being filmed in New Zealand.   The troops in the battle scenes are computer-generated orcs, elves, humans and dwarves that have been programmed with a few rules that define their fighting style, who their enemies are and what to do when a foe has been killed.   Battle commences when the troops are unleashed on each other and computer cameras record the flow of action.
Iceland launches energy revolution  By environment correspondent Tim Hirsch  In 1874 the science fiction writer Jules Verne envisaged a world in which water would replace coal as the fuel of the future.   Now the Icelanders believe they can turn that dream into reality within a generation - and they are taking the first steps next year in their project to create the world's first hydrogen society.   Iceland has already gone further than any other country in exploiting its abundant sources of renewable energy. Virtually all of its electricity and heating comes from hydroelectric power and the geo-thermal water reserves tapped from the hot rock layers lying just beneath the surface of this extraordinary island.

urlLink Are We Not Geeks?     Tolkien and his keen readers are often criticised for being stuck in eternal adolescence, and labelled as geeks. I'd like to take a closer look at these labels.   Consider how many useful and pragmatic people read therapy and self-help books because they're want to fulfil their potential as balanced, self-aware individuals. Many of these books talk about the notion of nurturing one's 'inner child.' The inner child is that part of us that feels enthusiasm and joy most strongly, and which responds most truthfully to the world. Well and good; evidently the "inner child" is regarded as good and precious. But what can we say about the inner adolescent? Why aren't we nurturing the inner adolescent?   I think you can hardly say the phrase 'teenager' these days without immediately thinking of somebody rebellious and confused, or remembering one's own years of irritable awkwardness. We haven't got a lot good to say about teenagers, and yet we should. The author Philip Pullman wrote something very interesting in response to a question about why he preferred to write for and about teenagers.   At that age, he said, children are becoming aware of the world in a new way, and they have time to ask the big questions: What is the meaning of life, why are we here, what is our purpose? Later on we get busy, we get cynical, and we are in danger of forgetting we ever cared.   I'd agree with that. I'd go further and say that for many teenagers, those years are a time of great stress partly because it is an age of idealism and yet they are just beginning to learn about the world's tired habits - its petty hypocrisies, callous persecutions, deadly evasions of responsibility, casual negligence towards justice, and the ignoble worms of greed that gnaw away at the heart of every great enterprise... Teenagers rage against the wrongness of the world because they see it more freshly and it wounds them more keenly. As one becomes older, wiser, and tireder, it seems less hassle to take the easy course, to act circumspectly, to be politic more often than honest. I think teenagers rage against growing into that state, and the best of them still believe that they will change the world by virtue of naming and confronting its evils.   I'd like to throw in one of the ultimate Romantic poems I've ever come across. It's by an Argentinean poet, and to me it sums up that idealism of adolescence which rejects the deceitful world with one grand gesture:   For Afterwards  I would like to die when the day is ending on the open sea and looking at the sky; where the agony of death may seem but sleep and the soul may seem a bird which mounts in flight.  And in the final instants I would hear, already with the sky and sea alone, no other sobbing prayers or sobbing voices than those of waves in their majestic fall.  To die when life is sadly hauling back  its golden nets from out the tide's deep green and be like yonder sun that dies down slowly: some very shining thing that's lost from sight.  To die, and young, before unfaithful time destroys the delicate and gentle crown; whilst life still tells us: I am yours although we know so well it will betray us.  Manuel Gutierrez (1859 - 1895) (Translation: Gordon Challis)  Yes, a modern person might find this sentimental and grandiose. It is utterly fantastical in its all-or-nothing approach to life. It offers no gritty pragmatic solutions to the problem of living in a less-than-perfect world. It may be adolescent in its grand gesture of utterly rejecting the world in all its complex awfulness. But would the world be a richer place if everything as great, beautiful and futile as this poem, were banished from our consciousness? I could not bear the loss.   For this is the inner teenager that Tolkien and many other fantasy books appeal to. They are books that are about honour and justice and the recognition of absolute good and evil; they are books about daring and courage and ultimate sacrifices and grand gestures against hopeless odds.   Nobody has lost that inner teenager who has flung aside their life and decided to change a political system or overturn a scientific belief; or who has shrugged off convention in order to embark on a great love affair across continents and oceans. Sadly, it is the inner teenager we appeal to when we send young men off to die in wars; but it is my belief that all those who have risked their lives to stand up against oppression and injustice called on their inner teenager too. Because when teenagers look at the status quo they see wrongs, and they name them truthfully, whether society wants to hear or not.   The whole question of geekdom has interested me for a while too. Other people are involved in writing more about this, but I'll take the liberty of pre-empting their more extensive study with a few thoughts. Firstly, what is a geek? Articles like Julian Dibbell's 'Lord of the Geeks' article on Village Voice seem to deride geeks as a minority of outsiders while simultaneously fearing that they're some vast inchoate conspiracy which controls the technology underpinning our modern world. They're losers, he thinks, but by some unfair twist of fate and genetics, they get to spend their lives doing cool things with art, science, technology, popular culture and the media. (And I might add that some of them get shockingly rich doing it too, and have to travel round the world for their pains.)   My own definition of geeks is this: A geek cares about a subject or system so much that they're willing to learn how to master it, whether anyone else cares about it or not. The link between geeks and teenagers exists because before that age, if a child is fascinated by something, we just think they're absorbed in play. It's only when they hit their teen years that we notice geeks because there's some expectation that they should be out partying and socialising. Instead they sometimes - or often - put aside their interest in other people because they'd rather be problemsolving on their computer, or memorising the entire history of the Plantagenets, or thinking up stories about an imaginary world, or practicing scales for three hours on the violin. Sometimes they're fixed on a goal known only to themselves, sometimes they've found a close-knit gang with similar interests, but in any case they'll follow their own instincts or interests, no matter what anybody else thinks.   The larger group of non-geeks is always going to be nervous of somebody who resists the easiest form of social control, which is shame. In their eyes, you should be able to laugh at somebody and tease them for being different, and that should be sufficient to make them toe the line and make a bit more of an effort to appear similar to everyone else. Geeks resist that because, well, it'd mean giving up the things that matter more than conformity.   There's always been geeks. Mozart? What a nerd! He had to be a geek. Who illuminated medieval manuscripts? Who preserved literacy during the difficult, violent centuries of the Dark Ages? Geek monks who remembered what civilisation was! Who were Pythagoras and Socrates and Archimedes? Total geeks every one of them, with their heads in the clouds.   And so I ask, if anything worth doing is to be done: Are we not geeks?   written by tehanu@theonering.net

Japan Scientists Grow Artificial Eyeball -Kyodo TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese scientists have succeeded in growing artificial eyeballs for the first time in the world, Kyodo news agency said Saturday.  A group of researchers led by Makoto Asashima, biology professor at Tokyo University, succeeded in growing eyeballs in tadpoles using cells taken from frog embryos, Kyodo said.  ``Since the basics of body-making is common to that of human beings, I think this might help enable people to regain vision in the future,'' Asashima was quoted as saying.  The group, after soaking undifferentiated cells from the embryo of a Platanna frog in a special medium, transplanted the eyeball into a tadpole whose left eye had been removed before it was hatched, Kyodo said.  A week after the transplant, Asashima's group confirmed the tadpole's eyeball was connected to the optic nerves and there were no rejection symptoms, it said.   http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20020105/sc/japan_eyeball_dc_1.html
urlLink The Lioness and the Oryx  A lioness in central Kenya has baffled wildlife experts by adopting a baby oryx, a kind of small antelope normally preyed upon by big cats.   Reports say the full-grown lioness came across the oryx two weeks ago in the Samburu Game Reserve, scaring off its mother. Instead of then attacking the defenceless calf, the lioness adopted the baby, protecting it from other predators, including a leopard.   Extraordinarily, the lioness still allowed the mother oryx occasionally to come and feed her calf before chasing her away
Human Rights  Dutch civil servants wed nearly 2,000 same-sex couples during the first six months after gay marriages were legalized in 2001, a government agency said Wednesday.

urlLink Turkish women get equal rights  The new year sees the start of a quiet revolution in Turkish society, when centuries of legally enshrined inequality between the sexes are brought to an end.   From 1 January, Turkish men are no longer regarded by law as the head of the family. These latest measures included in sweeping reforms to the country's civil code are described by Turkey's Justice Minister, Hikmet Sami Turk, as the result of no less than 50 years' hard work.   Women are now legally allowed to take a job without first seeking their spouse's permission, and their husbands no longer have the right to decide unilaterally where a couple will live.   But by far the most significant element of the new legislation is the provision that married women are entitled to an equal share of joint assets in the event of divorce.

urlLink How Cheese is Made  Milk is separated and standardised to obtain the desired fat content for the cheese. Some factories like Lichfield also add or remove protein to obtain a desired protein level. It is then pasteurised and transferred to tanks where starter culture and a rennet enzyme is added.  Curdling Rennet, usually obtained from the stomach of calves, reacts with the casein protein in the milk to convert it into curd, the main element of cheese. This curd also contains a large proportion of whey, a watery substance full of sugar.

urlLink ENFP under stress  ENFP  ENFPs have a tendency to overextend themselves in both their physical and emotional commitments. Their proclivity to procrastinate and to overlook details complicates their circumstances. ENFPs often move on to new ventures without completing those they have already started. Their charming personalities can show signs of irritability and over-sensitivity when their desires to please different people come into conflict. During times of stress, ENFPs feel alienated. They then engage in deceptions that serve to obscure what is occurring within themselves.  The ENFP finds symbolic meanings behind the immediate circumstances. These meanings are construed as foreboding problems when ENFPs are under stress. Having a pervasive feeling of losing control over their own independent identities, ENFPs will feel virtually split apart by intruding circumstances. They will be "besides themselves" and "just not all there" \97 as if something, or someone, has taken away the essence of who they are. Not feeling like themselves, the ENFP will become subject to their own feelings of shame for being a phony, a fake or an impostor. If stress continues to grow, they may attribute malevolent schemes to others in order to explain away their fears.
urlLink Conflicting relations   These are relations of constantly developing conflict. Conflicting relations have the worst compatibility between partners among all other relations. However, it does not seem to be so obvious, especially in the earlier stages of development. Conflicting partners appear rather attractive, interesting and with impressive abilities.   Both partners are usually convinced that they can coexist and collaborate quite peacefully, but soon it becomes apparent that something is always going wrong, making their relationship problematic. Both partners may mistakenly think that the cause of these problems is minor and easily fixed and that all they need to do is to show a little bit more effort in understanding their partner.   Unfortunately, these attempts to continue pushing their relationship any further will soon provoke an open conflict between the partners. When conflict starts, partners hit each other with arguments exactly in the direction where they can cause maximum pain. In return, the other partner may counterattack even more aggressively. With every conflict these relations become worse and worse.   Although Conflicting partners show confidence where their partner is unconfident, they are unable to protect and take care of each other's weak points. This regularly brings disagreement and disappointment into these relations. When after several fruitless attempts to establish a stable relationship the partners give up and break the relationship, they feel saved and released.   ISTj - ENFp
urlLink Abercrombie & Fitch Asian caricatures T-shirts cause outrage    (04-18) 09:42 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --  A new line of T-shirts depicting stereotypes of Asians has triggered an e-mail and phone campaign to boycott clothier Abercrombie & Fitch, which caters to the young, active set.   One of the Ohio-based company's t-shirts reads "Wong Brothers Laundry Service -- Two Wongs Can Make It White" and shows two smiling men with slanted eyes wearing conical hats.   Abercrombie said the shirts were supposed to be funny and cater to Asian customers.   "We personally thought Asians would love this T-shirt," said Hampton Carney, a spokesman for the company.   The T-shirts prompted a late-night meeting of Stanford University students Wednesday. The Asian American Students' Association encouraged calls to the company, and said Abercrombie & Fitch should apologize.   "It's really misleading as to what Asian people are," said Michael Chang, vice chairman of the student organization. "The stereotypes they depict are more than a century old. You're seeing laundry service. You're seeing basically an entire religion and philosophy being trivialized."   One shirt features a smiling Buddha figure with the slogan "Abercrombie and Fitch Buddha Bash -- Get Your Buddha on the Floor". Another shirt reads "Wok-N-Bowl -- Let the Good Times Roll -- Chinese Food & Bowling."   Abercrombie apologised for the offense caused after the first protest broke out.

urlLink SELF-HELP: Divorce  DIVORCE: A Crisis, Any Way You Look At It   If you are currently facing the realities of a divorce--either as a partner in a failing marriage, or as a child of parents whose marriage is ending--you are not alone. More than two and one-half million adults divorce every year; and more than a million children become children of divorced parents.   Divorce is a CRISIS of major proportions, second only to death of a spouse or parent in terms of the emotional trauma, stress, and upheaval it causes. According to the dictionary, a "crisis" is a situation whose outcome decides whether possible bad consequences will occur. That is, a crisis is not automatically a disaster; it is only potentially so. In fact, the Chinese word for crisis is composed of symbols meaning DANGER and OPPORTUNITY. The process of coming to terms with a divorce (or any other crisis/loss, for that matter) necessarily involves consideration of both its dangers and opportunities.   The dangers associated with divorce can be summed up in one word--LOSS. Whether you are a partner willingly seeking divorce or a partner who is resisting the action or a child who has no choice in the matter, you will incur serious losses as a result of divorce. Recognizing the extent of the losses--economic losses, loss of your home, loss of previous social life, loss of daily contact with children, loss of household help (i.e., your partner) , loss of in-laws, loss of routine, to name a few--is the first step toward identifying, understanding, and resolving the wide range of intense feelings that accompany such losses.   It is important to realize that the above losses result in emotional trauma. Reactions in the early stages of loss/trauma can include numbness, shock, and denial as well as helplessness, despair, and terror. In these early stages, it is helpful to acknowledge the losses and the tremendous pain associated with them; to remind yourself that you will survive; to recognize the universality of loss reactions and that you are not alone; to remind yourself that it is normal and healthy to experience pain with loss and encourage yourself to sit with the pain; to take care of yourself by getting rest, allowing friends to give you support, building in structure to counter the sense of being out of control, giving yourself room for mistakes, seeking out the comfort of others who have experienced similar losses; and seeking help and guidance immediately, if you think you need it.   A later stage in the loss process involves aspects of mourning. Feelings most often associated with this stage are anger and depression. Again, it is important to understand and accept these feelings as legitimate. It is also important to give yourself time to experience and work through these feelings, rather than allowing yourself to run away through compulsive activities, new relationships, or acting out the feelings through self-defeating behaviors or activities.   The dangers of divorce for children are similar to those listed above but more intense. For children, a divorce means the loss of their family as they have known it. This loss most often stimulates overwhelming fears of abandonment, threat, and disaster. Furthermore, most children lack the emotional equipment to deal constructively with these intense feelings. Thus, they often engage in acting-out behaviors which can bring on more trauma and loss. To help them cope with the dangers of divorce, children need direct, non-blaming and honest information about what is happening and what they can expect. They need reassurance that their parents are not divorcing them, and that the parent-child relationships will be preserved and protected at all costs. They need to be protected from the negative or bitter feelings in the marriage. They need structure and routine and consistency. Finally, they need help in identifying and legitimizing the many intense and scary emotions they are feeling. And they need to be given alternatives for expressing and coping with these feelings.   As stated earlier, the crisis of divorce involves not only danger but also opportunity. Once the traumatic feelings of pain and loss are being managed and the survival stage worked through, one can approach the healing and growing stages of loss/divorce. The crisis of divorce necessarily presents new beginnings. it offers the opportunity for self-examination and self-renewal, which, in turn, bring growth and fulfillment. At this point, it is possible to view a divorce, not as a failure, but as a learning experience. Through such processes as forgiving (self and others) , focusing on the gain that comes from pain, taking constructive action, discovering new relationships and new interests, and rediscovering yourself, one is able to build joy, excitement, creativity, and peace back into your life. For many, they end up with a better life and self than they started with before the crisis.   For most of us, the challenge of coping with both the dangers and opportunities of divorce are enormous. There are many books available to assist you in these challenges. Two useful ones are Divorcing by Kranzler and Belli (detailing the emotional and legal/logistical aspects of divorce) and How to Survive the Loss of a Love by Colgrove, Bloomfiled and McWilliams (dealing with emotional survival, healing, and growing from loss in general). Also be reminded that there are professionals on campus who understand the painful realities of divorce and who can help you survive and eventually thrive following divorce. Consult with the Counseling Center in Shoemaker Hall (314-7651) or the Mental Health Clinic in the Health Center (314-8106). They offer support and help.

urlLink   THE FOUR EMOTIONAL STAGES OF DIVORCE WORK by Phil Rich, Ed.D., MSW. The End of Marriage   The hallmark of the marriage is the expectation that this is to be a permanent relationship, in which both partners commit their lives to one another, joining their individual lives together in mutual co-existence. Accordingly, the breakup of a marriage can be devastating and life disrupting.   Divorce may be the sensible route to go for any number of reasons, but nevertheless unless completely amicable and acceptable to both parties, divorce represents the ending of a romance and the failure of a partnership in marriage, and is bound to have an emotional impact on one or both partners. Regardless of the circumstances of a divorce or the conditions that led up to it, the clear basis for any divorce work is the idea that the break up of a marriage is a loss.   Divorce is composed of both "technical" and "emotional" aspects. The technical aspects will be taken care of, one way or another by the legal process. But the "other" side of the process deals with the emotional aftermath. This is "divorce work" -- the process of dealing with and working through the sense of loss, emotions, and situations caused by the divorce.    The Emotional Stages of Divorce  Although every divorce is highly personal and unique, it can help divorcees to know that they're not alone in their confusion and despair, and that things improve over time. At this difficult time, it can help to understand what's typical in the divorce process, what to expect from their emotions and their life as their divorce progresses through the final decree and beyond, and the sort of emotional and practical issues that they're likely to experience, and in what order. These are the "emotional" stages of divorce -- the sequence of feelings and issues that divorcees typically go through.   The necessary emotional aspects of divorce work, include:  facing the reality of the divorce  working through painful feelings  experiencing the full range of emotions associated with the breakdown of a marriage  coping with the situational and lifestyle changes resulting from loss  adapting to the change, and reconfiguring life    Stage 1:  "Shock and Disbelief" begins as soon as the idea of a separation and divorce is introduced and sinks in. It involves four major tasks and issues to be worked through.  Facing reality  Self esteem and inadequacy  Telling the world  Support and help    Stage 2:  "Initial Adjustment" involves the ability of people to actively adapt to this new phase of their lives. The primary goal of this stage is adaptation and mustering the personal resources needed to manage the many emotional and practical changes faced by people during this phase of their divorce work, and tasks include:  Functioning and responsibility  Practical reality  Legal Matters  Managing emotions    Stage 3:  "Active Re-organization" centers around how people live their lives and cope with the tasks of being suddenly single. Major tasks to be dealt with and worked through include:  Managing life style and practical affairs  Re-defining relationships  Reconstructing personal values and beliefs  Concluding legal procedures    Stage 4:  "Life Re-formation" represents the final steps as readers pass through to the "other" side of their divorce. During this stage people deal with the emotional issues and life choices involved as they move on with their lives.  Constructing relationships  New interests  Personal responsibility  Accepting your new life    Summary and Conclusion  The first stage of the divorce typically passes the most quickly. It's the quick hit, and sometimes numbing shock wave, as people realize their marriage is over. The second and third stages are the most active and represent the bulk of active divorce work, covering the most active legal, practical, and emotional changes in life after divorce. The final stage represents that time in life during which divorcees are moving far away from their divorce, and into their new life. This stage really has no formal "end," and is marked by the full acceptance of the divorce and a resolution of most of the practical issues and many of the emotional.   Of course, the reality is that many of the various tasks of each stage overlap. And things aren't as clean and neat as checking off one task and then moving on to the next. But helping divorcees recognize these stages and tasks can be an enormously useful way to help them see and understand the path that lies ahead for them.   References:  Burns B., & Whiteman, T.

urlLink   Question: You've discussed briefly some of the physiological and emotional differences between the sexes. Could you list other physical characteristics unique to males and females?   Dr. Dobson Responds:  Men and women differ in countless ways, many of which they aren't even conscious of. Here are just a few of those differences:   1. A woman has greater constitutional vitality, perhaps because of her unique chromosomal pattern. Normally, she outlives a man by three or four years in the U.S. Females simply have a stronger hold on life than males, even in the uterus. More than 140 male babies are conceived for every 100 females; by the time birth occurs, the ratio is 105 to 100, with the rest of the males dying in spontaneous abortions.159   2. Men have a higher incidence of death from almost every disease except three: benign tumors, disorders related to female reproduction, and breast cancer.160   3. Men have a higher rate of basal metabolism than women.161   4. The sexes differ in skeletal structure, women having a shorter head, broader face, less protruding chin, shorter legs, and longer trunk. The first finger of a woman's hand is usually longer than the third; with men the reverse is true. Boys' teeth last longer than do those of girls.162   5. Women have a larger stomach, kidneys, liver, and appendix, and smaller lungs than men.163   6. Women have three very important physiological functions totally absent in men--menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation. Each of these mechanisms influences behavior and feelings significantly. Female hormonal patterns are more complex and varied. The glands work differently in the two sexes. For example, a woman's thyroid is larger and more active; it enlarges during menstruation and pregnancy, which makes her more prone to goiter, provides resistance to cold, and is associated with the smooth skin, relatively hairless body, and the thin layer of subcutaneous fat that are important elements in the concept of personal beauty. Women are also more responsive emotionally, laughing and crying more readily.164   7. Women's blood contains more water (20 percent fewer red cells). Since red cells supply oxygen to the body, she tires more easily and is more prone to faint. Her constitutional viability is therefore strictly a long-range matter. When the working day in British factories, under wartime conditions, was increased from ten to twelve hours, accidents among women increased 150 percent; the rate of accidents among men did not increase significantly.165   8. Men are 50 percent stronger than women in brute strength.166   9. Women's hearts beat more rapidly than those of men (80 versus 72 beats per minute). Their blood pressure (ten points lower than men) varies more from minute to minute, but they have much less tendency to high blood pressure--at least until after menopause.167   10. Female lung capacity is about 30 percent less than in males.168   11. Women can withstand high temperatures better than men because their metabolism slows down less.169   12. Men and women differ in every cell of their bodies because they carry a differing chromosomal pattern. The implications of those genetic components range from obvious to extremely subtle. For example, when researchers visited high school and college campuses to study behavior of the sexes, they observed that males and females even transported their books in different ways. The young men tended to carry them at their sides with their arms looped over the top. Women and girls, by contrast, usually cradled their books at their breasts, in much the same way they would a baby.170   Who can estimate how many other sex-related influences lie below the level of consciousness?

Subject: Story for you.... Date: Mon, 9 Sep 2002 19:27:36 -0600 From: Jafree To: Heather   Uniqueness  Beyond superiority and inferiority  Every human being is unique. There is no question of anybody superior or anybody inferior. Yes, people are different.   Let me remind you of one thing; otherwise you will misunderstand me. I am not saying that everybody is equal. Nobody is superior, nobody is inferior, but nobody is equal either. People are simply unique, incomparable. You are you, I am I. I have to contribute my potential to life, you have to contribute your potential to life. I have to discover my own being, you have to discover your own being.  When inferiority disappears, all feeling of superiority also disappears. They live together, they cannot be separated. The man who feels superior is still feeling inferior somewhere. The man who feels inferior wants to feel superior somewhere. They come in a pair; they are always there together; they cannot be separated.   It happened... A very proud man, a warrior, a samurai, came to see a Zen master. The samurai was very famous, well known all over the country, But looking at the master, looking at the beauty of the master and the grace of the moment, he suddenly felt inferior. Maybe he had come with an unconscious desire to prove his superiority. He said to the master "Why am I feeling inferior? Just a moment ago, everything was okay. As I entered into your court suddenly I felt inferior. I have never felt like that. My hands are shaking. I am a warrior, I have faced death many times, and I have never felt any fear--why am I feeling frightened?"   The master said, "You wait. When everybody has gone, I will answer." People continued coming to visit the master, and the man was getting tired, more and more tired. By the evening the room was empty, there was nobody, and the samurai said, "Now, can you answer it?" And the master said, "Now, come outside."   A full moon night--the moon was just rising on the horizon... And he said, "Look at these trees, this tree high in the sky and this small tree. They both have existed by the side of my window for years, and there has never been any problem. The smaller tree has never said, 'Why do I feel inferior before you?' to the big tree. How is it possible? This tree is small, and that tree is big, and I have never heard any whisper."   The samurai said, "Because they can't compare."   The master said, "Then you need not ask me; you know the answer."   Comparison brings inferiority, superiority. When you don't compare, all inferiority, all superiority, disappear. Then you are, you are simply there. A small bush or a big high tree--it doesn't matter; you are yourself. You are needed. A grass leaf is needed as much as the biggest star. Without the grass leaf God will be less than he is. The sound of the cuckoo is needed as much as any Buddha; the world will be less, will be less rich if the cuckoo disappears.   Just look around. All is needed, and everything fits together. It is an organic unity: nobody is higher and nobody is lower, nobody superior, nobody inferior. Everybody is incomparably unique.

urlLink Haiku For Beginners    I guess the first thing you noticed is that they're short - two or three lines only. There are not many words in those lines either. And you didn't hear rhymes, did you?   Beyond their physical form, these poems obviously have something else in common. It is something to do with the subject matter and the direct method of presentation. If we had time to discuss it we could refine that thought until we had something like this.   The poems speak  - about experience from the senses  - directly and with intensity  - about observation of nature   They seek to construct a clear and significant image in our minds or perhaps to juxtapose or contrast two such images. Usually it is an image from nature or from daily life. Perhaps though, to say that the poem 'constructs' the image in our mind is a bad way of saying it. Really the poem is reminding us of something we've already seen, heard or felt. That's how they manage to conjure up so complex an image with so few words. One possibility is to go with what you know now.   Let me first remind you of the rules I've already given you. The poem should be start with an image or a pair if them. It should be direct from sense experience, without metaphor, simile or rhyme. Haiku is of course a traditional Japanese form with further strict rules of construction. Not all are honoured outside Japan and even there some are defiantly broken. To what I've already stated let me add three more stipulations.   three lines with 5 syllables, 7 syllables, then 5  one kigo or season word  one kireji or cutting word   The first rule is the most well known and it is the one most mentioned by writers on the subject of haiku. The idea is simple. Write a line of five syllables, follow it with a seven-syllable line and then use five syllables to make the final line. This gives you two short lines divided by a longer one. It goes a long way to guiding the method of expression in the poem.   There is a good deal of controversy about this rule; but let's skip that for the moment and talk about the third. The kireji or cutting word is used to divide the haiku into two parts. Obviously this should be used to enhance the juxtaposition of images we discussed earlier. In English the tendency is to use punctuation, such as "-" or ":" to perform this function.   The second rule that requires the use of a kigo or season word helps establish the season or time of year that the poem describes. For English-language haiku this rule is taken to remind the writer that the poem should be grounded in nature.   But most important is that the form isn't the goal here. It's to write a good poem. So the exercise of writing haiku oneself is very important. Occasional reading and discussion on the form, tradition and history of haiku and reading others' haiku all help to feed the writing with new ideas and approaches.
African Ice Core Analysis Reveals Catastrophic Droughts, Shrinking Ice Fields, Civilization Shifts  COLUMBUS, Ohio \96 A detailed analysis of six cores retrieved from the rapidly shrinking ice fields atop Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro shows that those tropical glaciers began to form about 11,700 years ago. The cores also yielded remarkable evidence of three catastrophic droughts that plagued the tropics 8,300, 5,200 and 4,000 years ago. Lastly, the analysis also supports Ohio State University researchers' prediction that these unique bodies of ice will disappear in the next two decades, the victims of global warming.

urlLink A Summary of the Twelve Houses   The Twelve  houses of the horoscope define twelve areas of our life.  The beginning of each of the houses is called the cusp.  Each house has what is called a natural sign and natural ruling planets.  This is the sign and planet which are associated with that house in the natural chart beginning with Aries and ending with Pisces.  The Astrodienst charts show another division of the houses.  This division places the houses in groups that are on the angles, the angular (ang); houses that follow immediately behind each angular house, the succedent (suc) houses, and the third in line, the cadent (cad) houses. There are four each, angular, succedent, and cadent houses. Older books taught that planets in the angular houses were somewhat stronger and planets in the cadent houses were weaker in influence. Now little attention is paid to this idea.
Osho Zen Tarot   Patience                        We have forgotten how to wait; it is almost an abandoned space. And it is our greatest                       treasure to be able to wait for the right moment. The whole existence waits for the right                       moment. Even trees know it--when it is time to bring the flowers and when it is time to let go                       of all the leaves and stand naked against the sky. They are still beautiful in that nakedness,                       waiting for the new foliage with a great trust that the old has gone, and the new will soon be                       coming, and the new leaves will start growing. We have forgotten to wait, we want                       everything in a hurry. It is a great loss to humanity.... In silence and waiting something inside                       you goes on growing--your authentic being. And one day it jumps and becomes a flame, and                       your whole personality is shattered; you are a new man. And this new man knows what                       ceremony is, this new man knows life's eternal juices.                         There are times when the only thing to do is to wait. The seed has been planted, the child is                       growing in the womb, the oyster is coating the grain of sand and making it into a pearl. This  card reminds us that now is a time when all that is required is to be simply alert, patient, waiting. The woman pictured here is  in just such an attitude. Contented, with no trace of anxiety, she is simply waiting. Through all the phases of the moon  passing overhead she remains patient, so in tune with the rhythms of the moon that she has almost become one with it. She  knows it is a time to be passive, letting nature take its course. But she is neither sleepy nor indifferent; she knows it is time to  be ready for something momentous. It is a time full of mystery, like the hours just before the dawn. It is a time when the only  thing to do is to wait.
urlLink Robert E. Wilkinson 's The Quantum Brahman   In their search to explain the mechanics of creation, the world's leading theoretical physicists have determined that there are four fields of force in the universe. Scientists have been able to reduce and classify these fields in categories according to the strength of the force that they carry, and the particles with which they interact. The first of these categories is the Gravitational Force. It is the weakest of the four forces and has two special properties; it is able to act over large distances and is always an attractive force. The gravitational force is present in large bodies such as the Sun, Moon and Planets. The second category is the Electromagnetic Force which operates over short distances and interacts with electrically charged particles. While it is much stronger than the gravitational force, this force operates on the very small scale of atoms and molecules which possess two kinds of electrical charges, positive and negative, that tend to attract or repel one another. The third category called the Weak Nuclear Force, is responsible for radioactivity and is found in many nuclear decay processes that involve neutrinos. In 1979, scientists were able to develop a theory which successfully unified the weak nuclear force with the electromagnetic force as they had earlier been able to unify the forces of electricity and magnetism. It is now called the Electro-weak force. The fourth category, called the Strong Nuclear Force, binds particles together into combinations. Matter is mostly made up of protons and neutrons which in turn are made up of quarks. The strong nuclear force holds the quarks together in the proton and neutron and hold protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom.   While these four forces account for the theoretical dynamics of matter they do not appear to interact with each other in a manner sufficient to suggest a single unified field theory which could explain the natural ordering of the universe. This problem has forced scientists to continue their search for an as yet unidentified 5th field in nature which they hope will provide the basis for this long sought unification. Their search for this mysterious 5th field has led them to speculate about a sub-quantum reality described by the ancient sages as the Luminiferous Ether. It was believed to be an invisible medium that would fill all space and convey extremely subtle effects over large distances. To the world of science, this metaphysical possibility was not considered viable because physicists were not convinced that etheric forces played any significant role in physical interactions. But, upon closer investigation, they have come to believe that the Etheric may hold the key to the elusive 5th field. Leading theoreticians now conclude that this invisible sub-quantum field, capable of being the ground state of the universe, would be free of matter as well as the effects of gravitation. Since it resembles empty space, they appropriately named it the Quantum Vacuum. However, following more recent discoveries, they were forced to revise their notion of an etheric void in favor of new theories which suggest that the Quantum Vacuum is a highly charged cosmic medium; an energy-filled plenum whose subtle order measurably influences the space-time motion of the material universe. Scientists now agree that it was the Quantum Vacuum which gave birth to the observable universe. And they also believe that the 5th field which they are seeking is the interactive face of that plenum. A number of physicists now suspect that the dynamics of that interactive face hold the key to joining the fields of gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces in a Grand Unified Field Formula.   The discovery of the Quantum Vacuum appears to represent a major paradigm shift for modern science but, at this point in time, very little is actually known about this puzzling phenomenon. Physicists cautiously agree that the Quantum Vacuum gave birth to the observable universe; that it is the source and sink of all matter and, that it may prove to influence the space-time motion of matter. There is even a growing consensus among scientists that Vacuum Physics lie at the core of everything. But, in spite of all these advances, they are still faced with a monumental problem; the discovery of the Quantum Vacuum has not really solved anything, it merely postulated a zero point beyond which empirical science cannot go. They have finally arrived at the womb of creation, but it is exactly as the ancient sages always said, unmeasurable. The laws of physics break down at this resonant threshold because they are unable to measure its infinite density.   In order for science to arrive at a new system of knowledge which can unveil the interactive face of the Quantum Vacuum and measure the density of the Transcendent, it must first be willing to entertain a new understanding of Time. For Time is the key which unlocks the secrets of matter. For centuries physicists have been laboring under the illusion that Time was a derivative of Space even to the point of calling it 'Space-time' but, according to the sages, it is quite the opposite; Time is what gives birth to Space.   In his commentaries on the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, one of India's oldest and most profound metaphysical texts, the philosopher-sage, Sri Aurobindo discusses the occult imagery associated with this fundamental principle:   " ... The [image of the] horse is a physical figure representing like an algebraical symbol, an unknown quantity of force and speed. (Time is its breath, the year is its body, the seasons its limbs, the months and the fortnights its joints, the days and nights its feet.) From the imagery it is evident that this force, this speed, is something universal. Time in its period is the Self of the Horse Sacrificial, so not Matter but Time, is the body of this force of the material universe... Space then, is the flesh constituting materially this body of Time which the sage attributes to his Horse of the worlds, by movement in Space its periods are shaped and determined. Hence the real power, the fundamental greatness of the Horse is not the material world, not the magnitudes of Space, but the magnitudes of Time... for Time is that mysterious condition of universal mind which alone makes the ordering of the universe in Space possible."   Sri Aurobindo, The Upanishads; 'The Great Aranyaka', Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, 1971  In the higher ranges of consciousness, which the sages identify as the realm of pattern, all things exist in potentia, they are not here manifest. They may exist in Being but not in Time. They are precipitated into physical reality by the contracting power of Time. For it is Saturn/Chronos which differentiates the infinite energy-consciousness of the Supreme Godhead into material form.   In its native state, the Absolute is unbound, undifferentiated and eternal; One without a second. In order for the Incomprehensible to become intelligible to itself, it becomes dense, first becoming audible and then visible. It does this through a process of contraction which slows down the vibrations of the infinite consciousness, gradually congealing it into a spatial field containing material forms. It manifests first as Cosmic and Planetary harmonies before reaching a highly specific individuation in the human domain. Through this alchemical process, the Absolute is reduced from its original state of undifferentiated Unity into Form and Multiplicity. This act of contraction, is the basis upon which the Greek myths portray Saturn/Chronos as having dismembered his father.   In order to break the code of the Transcendent dimension, science must reverse this process of divine alchemy. It must abandon its philosophy of continued dismemberment or scientific reductionism in favor of a cosmological, or whole systems approach. Scientists must learn to embrace the view that material reality is not a collection of separate objects as it appears, but an undivided whole in which all parts merge and unite in one totality. Fortunately there are some theorists who recognize this possibility and are beginning to agree that the next great paradigm shift in science will be a cosmological revolution, because Cosmology, once the mother of all science, embraces the whole of reality and describes its order.   One of the most impressive theories emerging out of scientific cosmology respecting these ancient truths was set forth by the late physicist, David Bohm in his book, Wholeness and the Implicate Order. Using the language of mathematics, Bohm set out to describe the transcendent reality and its graded energetic hierarchy in four basic states or orders of energy beginning with the physical world, which he called the Explicate Order.   "The Explicate Order, weakest of all energy systems, resonates out of and is an expression of an infinitely more powerful order of energy called the Implicate order. It is the precursor of the Explicate, the dreamlike vision or the ideal presentation of that which is to become manifest as a physical object. The Implicate order implies within it all physical universes. However, it resonates from an energy field which is yet greater, the realm of pure potential. It is pure potential because nothing is implied within it; implications form in the implicate order and then express themselves in the explicate order. Bohm goes on to postulate a final state of infinite [zero point] energy which he calls the realm of insight intelligence. The creative process springs from this realm. Energy is generated there, gathers its pure potential, and implies within its eventual expression as the explicate order."   Will Keepin, David Bohm, Noetic Science Journal  When Bohm's resonant fields are arranged in a vibrational hierarchy they represent energy in successive states of manifestation from infinitely subtle to the gross physical reality.   The Zero Point Order which Bohm identified as the realm of insight-intelligence bears an unmistakable resemblance to the supreme spiritual realization of Indian metaphysics known as the Brahman, a perfectly inactive, pure noetic plenum realized as Absolute Being. Realization of the Brahman is characterized by a complete fusion of Time and Consciousness which we experience as Timelessness, or undifferentiated Time. In this state Time-energy vibrates at such an intense rate that is appears static and thereby lacking any element of periodicity or denseness. Hence it cannot produce any form or any division of Consciousness-substance into distinct crystallised objects in Space.   In the language of physics the Brahman would be infinite creativity in a resting or seemingly non-vibratory state, realized as Emptiness or a Void. It appears this way because, as energy moves toward an infinite state, its wave frequency increases. The amplitude or vertical distance between wave crests becomes smaller and smaller until the points of rest overlap, turning the oscillating wave into a straight line. In this manner, infinite energy may be realized as utter stillness or a zero point, precisely as the sages have said. Bohm obtained laboratory evidence of this phenomenon by proving the existence of wave lengths as small as 10 to the minus 34th power. His calculations indicate that one cubic centimeter of this Zero Point energy contains more power than all of the matter in the known universe.   Bohm's work with Zero Point energy is extremely helpful in understanding the metaphysical nature of the universe, especially the process by which the Absolute or Brahman becomes manifest in Time and Space. And while he was never able to define the details of that process, his groundbreaking theories represent a major paradigm shift, not only for the world of science but for spirituality as well, because, like Sri Aurobindo, Bohm's discoveries contradict the perennial philosophy which posits Emptiness or a Void as the highest spiritual realization.   "Nothing can arise from Nothing. Asat, nothingness, is a creation of our mind; where it cannot see or conceive, where its object is something beyond its grasp, too much beyond to give even the sense of a vague intangibility, then it cries out, "Here there is nothing." Out of its own incapacity it has created the conception of a zero. But what in truth is this zero? It is an incalculable Infinite... Our sense by its incapacity has invented darkness. In truth there is nothing but Light, only it is a power of light either above or below our poor human vision's limited range."  Sri Aurobindo, The Web of Yoga, Centenary Edition, Vol. 17, p. 48  Bohm's breakthroughs in quantum physics have opened the way for a new and productive relationship between ancient wisdom and modern science because, for the first time, they establish Fullness rather than a Void as the ground state of the universe. The implications of this discovery are immense, not only because it offers science a new conceptual paradigm which may hold the key to grand unification but it lays the foundation for a new cosmology in which the polarities of Spirit and Matter may finally be joined in an integral synthesis harmonizing the various expressions of mind, life and matter.   While these new theories hold exciting possibilities for science, they have been known and understood for millennia by the philosopher-sages of Vedic India. Long ago the Rishis postulated the existence of 5 fields with the 5th being the Etheric Plenum, or Fullness from which all things emerge. According to them, our material universe arose from a point or seed which lies at the resonant threshold of that Etheric Plenum. The Atharva Veda describes that point or seed as an 'Embryo [Hiranyagarbha] which, in the beginning, poured forth upon the universe a stream of gold.' This embryo or seed lies at the intersection of Time and Space, Spirit and Matter, where involutionary forms move across the event horizon and begin their linear evolution. In the language of scientific cosmology, this point or Seed is the singularity from which the universe exploded into being. In metaphysical terms it is the Luminiferous Ether, the OM or primordial vibration out of which the universe emerges and has its origin. All material creation issues from this original involved point or seed as involutionary forms move across the spatial threshold and begin to evolve linearly in accordance with the laws of causation and the principles of time. Once it crosses that resonant threshold the material universe is obliged to unfold in a manner that allows the Seer to follow the evolving in our Time measure of what was involved in that seed by compression or contraction.   Knowledge of this involutionary process was the most coveted secret of the Vedic Rishis because It allowed them to follow the unfolding of that Seed and 'See' with an understanding which could be infinitely extended to all orders of reality. They were able to observe this occult process by using a unique system of cosmological knowledge which could measure from the Transcendent reality to its physical manifestation in an unbroken line. This knowledge was hidden in the symbol language of the Rig Veda but over the millennia its meaning became clouded over. The Seer became displaced by the Nirvani as emphasis shifted from Gnosis to a philosophy of Illusionism which denied the material world in favor of the attainment of a Transcendent consciousness. As a result of this development, the bridge between the Transcendent and the Physical became lost and was soon considered irrelevant. It was understood that the Brahman permeated everything, but how it had become the All was once again a great mystery.   "When the realiser could no longer use the cosmos to express his spiritual experience, he introduced the cleavage...between form and essence. More importantly, that essence itself became deformed. The experience conveyed an unfocused vision of what is and immediately nothingness and voids became the way to describe that higher truth. This was a logical development in a world in which the cosmos lost its sense, its purpose and its relation of oneness to the human being and evolution of consciousness on Earth. Above all, creation became divested of true sacredness."   Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, The Vishaal Newsletter, October, 1988  Today, some two thousand years later, Science and Spirituality must face the consequences of these philosophies of illusionism which taught that Truth or Salvation, if it is to be attained at all, may only be realized in an afterdeath heaven or Nirvanic void - anywhere except the physical world we inhabit. The influence of these nihilistic philosophies has driven Science and Spirituality to the threshold of a major crisis in which both must discover a new and integrative paradigm in order to experience a meaningful continuity of existence. The key to that paradigm is a new understanding of Time and its primary role bridging the Transcendent and the Physical world.   "It cannot be denied that Time is a major feature of our material universe. In consequence, it stands to reason that when spirituality decides that the universal manifestation is unreal and illusory, Time is immediately shunned and the seeker is required to go 'beyond time', i.e., to the experience that appears to obliterate Time. Conversely, if we are engaged in a path that seeks a transformation of matter and an experience of the highest planes of reality in this material creation we are obliged to accept the instrumentation of Time. Furthermore, we must seek a means or a key by which Time itself becomes the element utilized in the gestation of a new and superior consciousness-form in the material creation."   Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, The New Way, Vol. 3, 1983  In the early 1970's Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, the world's leading authority on Vedic Cosmology, began to publish her ground breaking discoveries. She had recognized in the scriptures and mythologies of ancient India evidence of a highly enlightened cosmological culture. The Rishis, had developed precise formulas describing the dynamics of the involutionary process, and had woven these celestial equations into the structure of their myths and legends. Their knowledge of Time and the cosmic mysteries formed the basis of an ancient Yoga, the practice of which led to a supremely enlightened state known as Truth-Consciousness or Swar of the Veda. The Rishis understood that the Cosmos was a whole organism, multidimensional and sacred in its structure and form. They also knew that the difference between man/woman and the Cosmos was a matter of degree, rather than essence; that the Macrocosm and Microcosm had a correspondent equivalence. Through the repetition of certain rites, the sages believed that man could recover an awareness of his intrinsic identity with the Cosmos and thus perceive the hidden order of the world. Since this order was embedded in the structure and periodic movement of the Macrocosm, it was understood that a corresponding order could be discovered by the individual in the cycles and events of his own life. If man could learn to align himself with the harmonies of Cosmic Time, he would gradually become imprinted with their rhythms and realize within himself an immutable center or axis, from which he could acquire an entirely new orientation to his lived experience. Since the same Zero Womb, which gave birth to the universe is also the core of the human being, the unveiling of this Soul/center/axis in the individual led to a simultaneous realization of Truth-Consciousness or Gnosis.   This was the essence of the Rig Vedic Yoga, lost for millennia until it was unveiled in the 1970's by Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet. From the principles of these ancient teachings, Ms. Norelli-Bachelet developed and articulated a new applied cosmology which she demonstrates in her book, The Gnostic Circle, a synthesis in the harmonies of the cosmos.   "The Gnostic Circle is merely the combination of the zodiac the occult circle which contains the knowledge of the evolution and the structural pattern of the solar system. The Circle of 12 is the zodiac, and the Circle of 9 is our actual solar system, each orbit representing one year of Earth life. The joint harmony of these two, superimposed or synthesized in one circle, is what constitutes our key to the evolution and flowering of the seed of the Spirit. In fact we can say that the Gnostic Circle is mainly for this purpose: it shows mankind the ultimate and ideal perfection that can be attained during this particular phase of the evolution, during this great transition point from animal-mental to the more divine mankind."   Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet ,The Gnostic Circle, p. 159, 1975  Ms. Norelli-Bachelet deals with what, for centuries, has been divorced from traditional spirituality, the question of Time and Measure. Her cosmology reverses the long-standing perception of Time as the destroyer and presents mankind with an entirely new awareness of Time as the integrative mechanism by which a Divine purpose is expressed in the world. Her seminal work discloses the deepest truths of material Reality which include the Being as well as the dynamics of the Becoming of that same Being. "Time", says Norelli-Bachelet, "is the vehicle, the medium for the Absolute or Supreme Consciousness to be and to become and it is knowledge of this principle which integrates the Spiritual and Physical dimensions and grants the individual a direct experience of the Supreme within the physical manifestation ."   In Ms. Norelli-Bachelet's Cosmology, the Zero Womb or what science is now calling the Quantum Vacuum, has a symbolic correspondence to the Sun or primary Axis of our own Universe. The nine planets which orbit about the Sun represent the octaves or archetypes of form which have issued from that Zero/Womb/Axis. The planets also represent the number powers from 1 to 9 which form the mathematical basis of an ancient system of number harmonies called Cabalistic Reduction. Since every higher number is reducible to a simple number from 1 to 9, it is by means of number power that one is able to integrate the planetary harmonies with the harmonics of Number and relate the movement of the spheres to the Calendar which measures time periods on earth. Through this system of cosmic harmonies, the Gnostic Circle unveils the dynamic correspondences between Time and Space and describes the occult process by which energy-consciousness becomes crystallized into material forms.   By unveiling the Quantum Brahman or body of the Absolute, Ms. Norelli-Bachelet reveals for the first time the complete details of the involutionary process which occurs in the Zero Womb, and the reversal, or emergence from its interactive face of solidified energy or material form. She has rebuilt the bridge between Spirit and Matter in a seamless continuum, using the harmonics of our very own cosmos to describe its order. Through the use of her Gnostic Circle we now have the means to measure the dynamics of that Implicate reality and follow its manifestation in time as the Explicate universe. Ms. Norelli-Bachelet's work represents a quantum leap in cosmological knowledge and contains the seeds of a unique synthesis which promises to open the way for new and revolutionary advances in both science and spirituality.   2/12/96   Robert E.

urlLink No-Shame, No-Blame Creation Story   by Clare Puskarczyk   In the beginning...  there was an entity of light  within a lovely garden  which was also made of light.  A single being, with many aspects  living in peace and harmony.  When a serpent,  who knew well of matter said,  "Birth, Death, Rebirth."  The quality of the light being  that would become known  as the feminine said,  "Why Not? Exploration, process."  The masculine energy said,  "Structure, power."  And the serpent said,  Be aware, you may forget  who and what you really are."  She said, "We'll remember."  And she said to the masculine energy,  "I'll remind you of our light."  And he agreed,  and so they split in two,  into two separate beings,  and the Universe around them  became a duality, And they forgot.  And everything became heavy and  matter now mattered most of all.  Gravity became grave  in its seriousness  and grave as in death,  and they suffered,  and became ill,  and felt lost  and sometimes,  they almost remembered...  something.  and there were times...  when there was joy and light  but always a longing  to get back out of matter.  back to where?  And so they began to learn  how to use matter  and they thought they were powerful  and so a great battle began.  Everyone wanted to have power  power over matter  power over each other  power over thoughts and feelings  power over structures  especially the masculine beings  because their focus was structure.  And they took things apart  and made more...things.   And often...there was fear,  fear of each other,  fear of thoughts & feelings,  fear of the loss of structure.   Structures became institutions  But the feminine beings  were not preoccupied  with the institutions.  Instead they were occupied  with life,  with nature,  with babies  and a different order of things.   Sometimes...  she would remind him  of something,  but he thought he would  lose his power  if he remembered  and so he remained...forgetful.   And for this... he held power over her,  power over nature,  power over his own natural self,  as in control, repression, structure.   Fear kept these beings time-bound  and distanced them  from their light inside,  and their light remained interior  while they took everything apart.   Discovery pulled them forward  until almost everything  large and small  was in pieces.  what they didn't know was that  the external world was becoming  a reflection of themselves,  fragmented selves  with fragmented thoughts,  conflicts unresolved,  split inside.   And the external world  reflected opposites everywhere as in:  Good people don't kill, but...  we must have  war & weapons  to keep our power.  Good people don't lie, but...  we must deny and deceive  to keep our power.  Good people don't harm, but...  we must argue and abuse  to keep our power.   Yet behind all of this  there was still light,  and there were  those who would remember  something  and living differently  some of them stood out  as heroes...strangely enough.   Finally...  after many thousands of years,  when the world was full of  war and weapons,  denial and deception  and abuse of every kind,  and matter had contracted  as far as it could go,  little sparks of light  began to flash  more & more often  and remembering  began to manifest as:  concern for the environment,  conflict resolution,  love for one another  with integration and wholeness  bringing the fragments  back together.   Now...  individuals were creating community,  scientists discovering quantum leaps,  spiritual psychology learning  and teaching empowerment,  and the lights became brighter still.   Soon there were those  who remembered very well  that power was indeed interior,  that everything was made of light,  that evil meant  to live backwards in fear, and  that trust had  the vibrational quality  to bring light forward.   And that everyone together  had been Making it all up!   Even still...  people seemed to take sides.  And in the end,  those full of light  looked at those full of fear  and saw their light hidden inside  and loved them.   And those full of fear  looked at those full of love  and saw their light  and remembered their own,  and they all remembered together  and began to lighten up.  And soon  they found themselves  at home again... Back in the garden.

I think - therefore I am  You create your world! No other concept possesses the power that this idea does. Think about it? The power to change your world rests within yourself \96 within your mind!    Thought-creation is a fact of reality, all realities. This physical reality however, would often have you believe otherwise. When you believe that your fate is in the hands of people and things that are beyond your control, you lose that fundamental power given to you: the power to create. You make it that much easier for others to manipulate and change your world into what they want, instead of changing your world into what you want. Remember! You have a right to create your own world.    That right to create your own world was a gift to you from divine powers \96 divine powers, we might add \96 who cherish that right themselves. They would not think of relinquishing their power of self-creation and neither should you. Except, every time you feel that a particular situation is out of your hands, then that is what you are doing: relinquishing your power of creation and your ability to change the situation.    To reclaim back your creative power involves taking two steps, changing your belief, and learning how to control the consciousness you possess. Doing both will take time. However, the sooner you begin, the sooner you will reap the benefits of deliberate reality-creation.    To begin, you must shift from the belief that you live in a world you can\92t control, to a belief that you live in a world you can control. Along with this new belief, you must come to understand that the high-tech reality controlling device that you seek is your own consciousness. Your consciousness is the tool given to you by the divine that will enable you to change and shape your reality.    Learning how to control that consciousness is the next step in the process. Good reality-control comes from within, not without. An uncontrolled consciousness can be like a wild, untamed animal. This untamed animal gets driven by many sources to do the things it does, like emotions, needs, and desires. All these factors play a part in controlling and directing your consciousness toward deliberate reality creation. Except, in an uncontrolled state, your consciousness roams freely, like a wild beast. When a particular factor overwhelms the beast, that factor becomes the new director of the beast\92s world. This haphazard direction of consciousness is what you want to avoid. Your consciousness\92s driving forces must all be tamed and shown how they can work together to obtain what each needs and wants.    Now, to help make our point, let\92s take a few moments and show you a few common patterns that indicate a wild and untamed consciousness.      Does you mind wander regularly \96 jumping from topic to topic? In other words, if you counted the amount of things your mind dwelled on, during a given hour, would the number be above five items? Anything above five items, in a one hour period, points to mind-wandering. Mind wandering is one of the more subtle ways you undermine your reality control and a sure sign you have the makings of an untamed beast.   Do you continually look on the negative side of things? A negative outlook on your life is a sign that your emotions are controlling your consciousness \96 not you! Emotions, when used properly, can be a good motivator of reality creating. However, when you allow your emotions free reign, the beastly side of them takes over. Emotional runaway is the most destructive form of reality control and another strong indicator of a wild beast within.   Do you often feel mentally drained? Continual mental fatigue is an indication of poor inner-power regulation. With inadequate inner-power and poor inner-power control you can expect anything and everything to control your life. If you lack the inner-power and strength necessary to make the needed changes in your world, all the mental control in the world is not going to help you. Poor inner-power management is another way of self-defeating reality control and yet another example of something savage going on within you.   Do you consciously understand the mechanics behind thought-creation? Not knowing how a device operates \96 especially an inner device \96 can greatly hinder your ability to use it. A computer is no good if you haven\92t a clue how to operate it! Thought-creation is the same. Your consciousness needs to understand how to operate the inner and outer devices that enable you to control your world. Otherwise, you\92ll be like a wild animal searching for food, operating on instinct alone. While the animal may eat, it may not eat well or at all on some days. So, if you don\92t understand these inner and outer creation devices, your consciousness is operating on instinct alone and is operating on a very primitive level.    I\92m sure many of you answered \91yes\92 to some of these questions. Answering \91yes\92 does not make you a misfit; it just makes you unlearned. Being unlearned in the way consciousness does its job is inefficient and a waste of your personal resources. Because you live in a fast-changing world, deliberate reality control becomes a necessity. You must learn how to tame that beast, so that you can make your world the best it can be, for yourself and for others.    With a controlled and tamed consciousness you can expect some changes in the way things happen in your life. For one thing, nothing unpleasant will surprise you. You will create the world you want and need. There will be no lurking ugliness that will spring up at the last minute. If you do get ugliness, you will be aware of it well in advance because you will be aware of yourself creating it. Your mind will no longer be an unchartered territory. You will be fully aware of the contents of your mind at any given time. Plus, you will understand why you react in certain ways and in certain situations. When an awkward, unwanted, or an unusual situation arises, you will have the power to act and the power to move that situation in a direction that is desirable to you. You will be the master of your fate and the helmsman of your destiny.    You create your world! No other statement is more true. Now it is your job to learn how. Take the first step toward controlling your reality, and we can help you with the second. Recognize, at least a little, that you can and do have the power to create your world. You\92ve been doing it for years, since you were born and before. Then, let\92s take that second step together and learn how to properly use those inner tools \96 inner tools that will enable you to control the greatest gift in your possession, your own consciousness.      Worksheet Notes:   On the next page is your first worksheet. It is a questionnaire designed to show you your present level of reality creating ability. Please take the time to fill in the questionnaire because the real power in this questionnaire will reveal itself when you come back to it, after you\92ve finished the \93Hermes\92 Reality Creator I\94 course and retake the test. Your new score will show you how much you have progressed and how much farther you need to work the Reality Creating Game. Each question is designed to alert you to a different area of reality creating skill.   Question one shows you how positively you think about your reality.  Question two shows you how well you can control your lower self, your more base instincts, the animal part of you, if you will.  Question three shows you how well you can keep your mind focused in the present moment.  Question four shows you how well you can regulate your inner power (energy).  Question five shows you how easily you can be coerced by others.   After you take the test, then move on to the next chapter, but keep in mind the areas that you need to work on. As we get to that part of the book, you may want to pay extra attention to that section.
urlLink Health threat from computer use   Long haul air travel is not the only activity to pose a risk of developing potentially deadly blood clots - sitting at your computer for too long may also put you at risk.   The European Respiratory Journal reports the case of a young man from New Zealand who nearly died after developing deep vein thrombosis following long periods of physical inactivity in front of his computer. It may be similar to the situation with the risk of blood clots with long distance air travel. The man, the first recorded victim of a condition which has been dubbed e-thrombosis, spent up to 18 hours a day using his computer. He developed a massive blood clot that formed in his leg veins, broke off and travelled to his lungs.   Although the controversy about long-haul air travel has recently put DVT in the headlines, the condition was first described in people sitting on deckchairs in air raid shelters during the Blitz in London.

urlLink QuitNet QuitGuide  Physical Addiction Within just 7-10 seconds of inhaling cigarette smoke, nicotine begins affecting your brain.  Nicotine acts on cells in the \93reward center\94 of the brain.  This results in feelings of pleasure and alertness- the "hit" that your body comes to expect.  When bloodstream nicotine levels are at their peak, the brain is highly stimulated.  However, within just 30 minutes, your body has cleaned out most of the nicotine.  You then feel tired, jittery, depressed, or fatigued.  You begin to crave another cigarette, and the cycle continues.  This cycle, which increases in intensity and frequency over time, is part of what makes cigarettes so addictive.   Essentially, smoking becomes a never-ending battle of trying to stay within the \91comfort zone\92.
urlLink Help for Cravings and Tough Situations    What to Do Right Now and to Create a Smoke-free Future     For the first few days after you quit, spend as much free time as possible    in places where smoking is prohibited - libraries, museums, theaters,    churches.     Drink a lot of water and fruit juice.     Don't drink alcohol, coffee, and other beverages that you associate with    smoking.     Strike up a conversation instead of a match for a cigarette.     If you miss the feeling of having a cigarette in your hand, play with    something else - a pencil, a paperclip, a marble.     If you miss the feeling of having something in your mouth, try toothpicks,    cinnamon sticks or celery.     AVOID TEMPTATION by staying away from situations you associate with    pleasurable smoking.     FIND NEW HABITS and create a non-smoking environment around you.     Keep from picking up the habit again by anticipating future    situations/crises that might make you want to smoke again, and remind yourself    of your reasons to not give in.     Take deep rhythmic breaths similar to smoking to relax.     Remember your goal and the fact that the urge will eventually pass.     Think positive thoughts and avoid negative ones.     Brush your teeth.     Do brief bursts of exercise (isometrics, pushups, deep knee bends, walk up    a flight of stairs, or touch your toes).     Call a supportive friend.

urlLink People with Moon In Virgo  Does this sound like me?   Moon in Virgo Earth Sign   Emotionally spontaneous is not a phrase to describe a Virgoan Moon personality. Like their companion in the Earth signs, Taurus, there isn\92t the headlong rushing into commitments, either. Virgoan Moons don\92t overanalyze the relationship as much as they look at the value the relationship may have for themselves. They may hesitate to move at all unless they feel they are on solid ground, or there is some personal advantage to be gained by their emotional involvement.   As lunar Earth sign personalities, those with Moon in Virgo are guarded about their feelings. Virgoan Moons don\92t much care for discussing openly their emotions as if reporting their portfolio. This is not an ego issue like their neighbor, Leo, as much as it is a ploy to intrigue others to get to know them more intimately. It isn\92t easy loving a person with a Virgo Moon because they are over-critical in emotional expressions. Believe it or not, this Moon sign may actually be unrealistic at times about their own emotions. Their passion can sometimes be confused with compassion. An over-critical or too analytical approach to emotional situations makes it difficult for them (as well as the others involved) to freely or spontaneously express feelings. Serious-minded, with common sense about most things, they can be surprisingly unrealistic. As a result, they tend to gravitate to situations they know eel rather than explore and be adventuresome with their emotions. This leads Virgoan Moons too often repeating the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result each time and not getting it.  Virgo Moon personalities are emotionally adaptable. They instinctively seem to know what it takes to make others feel better. They make many friends because of their sympathetic nature, but it also means they are vulnerable to being exploited. Though they are not all scholars, they are likely to be fond of books and writing. Intellectual curiosity gives them a penchant for gathering information that can develop into serious research endeavors, or turn out to be just a fondness for gossip. At times they can be overly fastidious, usually with regard to eating habits. Concern with health makes many of them outstanding health care professionals. Their own preoccupation with health can become exaggerated to the point of hypochondria, or they can be guilty of using maladies to attract sympathy. They are mentally and emotionally stimulated by travel, communication, and information.
Subject: Remembering Martin Luther King, Jr.    Date:  Fri, 17 Jan 2003 13:58:56 -0800    From: "FAIR"        To:  "FAIR-L"                                     FAIR-L                     Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting                Media analysis, critiques and activism   Remembering Martin Luther King, Jr.   This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day comes as the U.S. is moving toward war in Iraq. As media prepare to air retrospectives on King, we thought it would be a good time to circulate this 1995 column by FAIR founder Jeff Cohen and FAIR associate Norman Solomon.   ------------------ Media Beat, January 4, 1995 The Martin Luther King You Don't See on TV By Jeff Cohen and Norman Solomon  It's become a TV ritual: Every year in mid-January, around the time of Martin Luther King's birthday, we get perfunctory network news reports about "the slain civil rights leader."  The remarkable thing about this annual review of King's life is that several years-- his last years-- are totally missing, as if flushed down a memory hole.  What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage: King battling desegregation in Birmingham (1963); reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington (1963); marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama (1965); and finally, lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis (1968).  An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968. Yet King didn't take a sabbatical near the end of his life. In fact, he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever.  Almost all of those speeches were filmed or taped. But they're not shown today on TV.  Why?  It's because national news media have never come to terms with what Martin Luther King Jr. stood for during his final years.  In the early 1960s, when King focused his challenge on legalized racial discrimination in the South, most major media were his allies. Network TV and national publications graphically showed the police dogs and bullwhips and cattle prods used against Southern blacks who sought the right to vote or to eat at a public lunch counter.  But after passage of civil rights acts in 1964 and 1965, King began challenging the nation's fundamental priorities. He maintained that civil rights laws were empty without "human rights"-- including economic rights. For people too poor to eat at a restaurant or afford a decent home, King said, anti-discrimination laws were hollow.  Noting that a majority of Americans below the poverty line were white, King developed a class perspective. He decried the huge income gaps between rich and poor, and called for "radical changes in the structure of our society" to redistribute wealth and power.  "True compassion," King declared, "is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring."  By 1967, King had also become the country's most prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, and a staunch critic of overall U.S. foreign policy, which he deemed militaristic. In his "Beyond Vietnam" speech delivered at New York's Riverside Church on April 4, 1967-- a year to the day before he was murdered-- King called the United States "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today."  >From Vietnam to South Africa to Latin America, King said, the U.S. was "on the wrong side of a world revolution." King questioned "our alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America," and asked why the U.S. was suppressing revolutions "of the shirtless and barefoot people" in the Third World, instead of supporting them.  In foreign policy, King also offered an economic critique, complaining about "capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries."  You haven't heard the "Beyond Vietnam" speech on network news retrospectives, but national media heard it loud and clear back in 1967-- and loudly denounced it. Time magazine called it "demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi." The Washington Post patronized that "King has diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people."  In his last months, King was organizing the most militant project of his life: the Poor People's Campaign. He crisscrossed the country to assemble "a multiracial army of the poor" that would descend on Washington-- engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol, if need be-- until Congress enacted a poor people's bill of rights. Reader's Digest warned of an "insurrection."  King's economic bill of rights called for massive government jobs programs to rebuild America's cities. He saw a crying need to confront a Congress that had demonstrated its "hostility to the poor"-- appropriating "military funds with alacrity and generosity," but providing "poverty funds with miserliness."  How familiar that sounds today, more than a quarter-century after King's efforts on behalf of the poor people's mobilization were cut short by an assassin's bullet.  As 1995 gets underway, in this nation of immense wealth, the White House and Congress continue to accept the perpetuation of poverty. And so do most mass media. Perhaps it's no surprise that they tell us little about the last years of Martin Luther King's life.  ------------------ Media Beat is Norman Solomon's weekly syndicated column on media and politics.

Nicotine is the addicting chemical in all forms of tobacco. It is a very powerful and dangerous drug - a small child can die from eating just two cigarettes. Nicotine causes the release of brain chemicals, which can give a "high" similar to other addicting drugs. It may be as addicting as heroin. The body goes through a physical "withdrawal" when the nicotine level drops - causing the "nicotine fit."   Nicotine withdrawal can be very unpleasant - many smokers find it difficult to quit due to nicotine addiction. Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, restlessness, craving nicotine, stomach problems, headaches and drowsiness. These symptoms must be addressed for most smokers to successfully become non-smokers.
urlLink TNT - The Power Within You  From Raphaela on 2/7/2003 11:41:34 AM   Stop bemoaning your fate and get wise to yourself. You have only two choices. You can either go higher or lower. You may take to drink or help yourself to a first-class nervous breakdown or wander around through the rest of your life, moaning about "what might have been" if you had only lived your life differently - but telling yourself "it's too late now".  But if you belong to that smaller percentage of men and women who have "gotten wise to themselves", you discover that it is never too late to get on the right track. You discover that you have been passing up the most wonderful force in your life, the creative power within, which has been ready and willing, at all times, to serve you.  A deep feeling of humility steals over you, and you lose your falsely assumed attitudes of egoism and self-importance forever. Once you are down to bedrock, you find that you have a foundation on which to build, that you can pick up your life again and make something of it, something finer than ever before, perhaps not so flashy or so gaudy, but so much more worthwhile, satisfying, healthful and enjoyable. Now, at last, you can decide what is best for you, without worrying about what the other fellow is going to do to you unless, perhaps, you do it to him first. There has come to you the inner assurance that whatever you need can and will be supplied to you by your creative power, if you keep in attunement with it, and direct it by right mental picturing. Not only this but you realize that you have been missing out on many things in life of far greater value than many of the things you thought you had to have a short time ago.....There is no way out, there is no way back, there is no other way but through.......Claude M.

urlLink Halliburton subsidiary wins Iraqi oil firefighting contract  WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US army said it gave the main Iraqi oilwell firefighting contract to a unit of Halliburton Co., a firm once run by Vice President Dick Cheney without any bidding.   Kellogg, Brown and Root, a unit of Houston, Texas-based Halliburton, was handed the contract by the Army Corps of Engineers, which has been placed in charge of fighting the blazes.   The contract had not been put out to tender, said the Corps spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Gene Pawlik.   Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) had already been asked by the Pentagon (news - web sites) to draw up plans for extinguishing oil well fires in Iraq (news - web sites), Pawlik noted.   "It made the most sense to engage them in the near term as the company to get the mission done because they were familiar with the details of the fires themselves and what would be needed," he said.   The value of the contract would depend on the scale of the work.   The chief of Britain's armed forces, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, said Friday that Iraqi forces had set fire to seven oil wells in the south of the country.   KBR would claim the cost of its services plus two to five percent depending on how it executed the job, Pawlik said.   "KBR was selected for this award based on the fact that KBR is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice," the company said in a statement.   KBR said it had teams of well control and engineering contractors preparing the initial phase.   The company was given a free hand to choose subcontractors for the work, the Corps spokesman said.   KBR chose Houston-based Boots and Coots International, with which it has a services and equipment partnership, and Wild Well Control Inc. as firefighting subcontractors.   President George W. Bush (news - web sites)'s spokesman, Ari Fleischer (news - web sites), said he did not have the details.   Asked about the contracting process, Fleischer told a news conference: "The question that people want to be answered is we have a plan in place to put out the oil fires. Refer your question to the agencies involved. I am not familiar with the details of this contract."   In a statement late Monday, the Defense Department said the Army Corps of Engineers would rely largely on contractors to extinguish the oil well fires and assess the damage to facilities.   Kellogg, Brown and Root was the prime contractor for the initial phase, Pentagon said. The contract would be in force for an interim period, until additional contracts were procured, it said.   "We have surveyed these wells and are preparing to mobilize the equipment," Boots and Coots president Brian Krause said in a statement.   "We will begin stabilization of the wells once the location around the wells is secure," he said.   Boots and Coots was brought into Kuwait in 1991 to control about 240 of more than 700 burning wells following the Gulf War (news - web sites), it said.   Cheney was chief executive of the KBR parent company Halliburton, a major oil services company, for five years until 2000.
urlLink PERSONAL MINISTRY: Advancing God's Kingdom  TOOLS OF THE TRADE Message # 4: (Selected Scriptures) Taught by Dr. Larry Osborne North Coast Church January 30 & 31, 1999  As in all families, joining God's family brings with it certain responsibilities. And one of our most important responsibilities is to help advance God's Kingdom. But how can we determine the specific assignment and role God has for us? That's what we'll discover today as we explore the importance of a personal ministry and the special tools called spiritual gifts that make it possible to carry out that ministry.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FAMILY CHORES    We all have a unique set of God given gifts, skills and resources.   I Corinthians 12:1 & 7/ I Corinthians 4:7/ James 1:17  We are responsible to use them to advance God's Kingdom.    I Peter 4:10-12/ Matthew 25:14-30 & Luke 19:11-27  If we don't use them, we lose them. Advancing God's Kingdom is NOT optional.  The goal is to match what we do best with where we're needed most.             WHAT DO I DO BEST? Discovering Our Spiritual Gift Mix   1) Our spiritual gifts may or may not match our passions and desires.                     Exodus 3:1-4:18/ I Chronicles 26:16-20  You can miss out on what God has for you by pursuing your desires.  2) Giftedness is based upon God's sovereignty not our spirituality.                     Romans 12:6 & I Corinthians 12:4-6/ I Timothy 1:12-16  3) The greater the glory, the less important the gift.       I Corinthians 12:21-26    4) The best way to discover our spiritual gifts is to do something and then check the result.       Matthew 25:14-30, Luke 19:11-27   WHERE AM I NEEDED MOST? Discovering Our God Given Assignment   THREE TOUGH QUESTIONS:  1) Do I have the right paradigm? (viewpoint) Am I looking at this properly? Am I out to win the war or am I being self-indulgent?  2) Do I have the right goal? Is my goal to serve the Lord or is it self fulfillment? Was your service hard or did it just make you feel good?  3) Am I making a real impact?       Matthew 26:36-45  When? Where? How?
Voyeurism   urlLink War in the digital age: Did you see that?  by Francis Till   Digital technology is bringing the war to the world in new, sometimes astonishingly immediate ways -- and the development is not always welcome.  Anyone caught without a television, for example, can watch a free, live webcast of downtown Bagdhad on a computer screen, 24/7, courtesy BBC News. That link works on internet-capable PDAs, by the way, which can hook up to wireless nets and provide broadband streams to anyone in an 802.11x cloud, even over coffee in a Starbucks anywhere.  Very early monday morning, that camera was trained on a bank of the Tigris river as Iraqi soldiers and police combed the reeds on the shore in search of what was later reported to be two downed American pilots.  The soldiers fired their automatic weapons into the river, violating whatever passes these days for the rules of handling capture, small boats flitted about in the water, angry crowds gathered on the bridge and along the river road.   The audio feed from the camera, which is adequate for loud sounds like traffic and bombs, caught the excited voices of the crowd and even some of the gunfire.  Al Jazeera cameramen were with the soldiers and moments after the webstream fed the images into computers all over the world, very similar pictures began to bloom on television as the Qatar-based station put its images up to satellites.  On BBC webstream 4, the talking heads in the newsroom were taking in the story and beginning to put it out to their global audience. BBC's webstream 4 is a duplicate feed of the news channel's broadcast, with slight variations: at times, it shows presenters during broadcast breaks, for example.  According to the presenters, RAF sources said they could account for all their flights and none were missing. Within 10 minutes, they had quotes from senior officials at the Pentagon making similar statements about American aircraft. Yet, clearly, something was taking place on the banks of the Tigris, where some of the gathered crowd had begun tossing torches into the reeds, hoping to burn the hiding airmen out.  Al Jazeera reported on television at that point that one American pilot had been captured and the crowd was searching for a second airman. According to Al Jazeera, both airmen had been seen parachuting into the river after their airplane had been shot down. Al Jazeera did not use modifiers.  Sky news, at that point, began inserting tag frames onto a picture of the search that quoted US Central Command saying that no coalition planes had been shot down.  On the webstream feed, the sky over Bagdhad began to show as a kind of eerie charcoal grey due to the plumes from burning oil pits, lit earlier in the day in a futile attempt to mask targets from the war planes and missiles.  Meanwhile, the webcam broadcast the sounds of an incoming air attack. Hours before, webcams and television cameras had streamed out images of long range bombers leaving remote bases. Now, they were quite possibly arriving over their target. A target full of civilians, exposed and too far away from shelters to reach what passes for safety in Bagdhad today.  As the crowd began to break up, heading for cover, word came over Sky News from American Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that, indeed, a UK warplane, with two pilots, was missing. Not the Tornado shot down earlier by an American Patriot missile, but another.  But then, it was revealed, he was speaking in only general terms, without specific knowlege.  And finally, an astute BBC reporter pointed out that many things -- bombs, equipment -- came down from airplanes in parachutes. Which might explain the conspicuous absence of a crashed airplane.  BBC World News, unfortunately anchored at that mid-afternoon (London time) hour by an earnest second-stringer, reported it by saying that Rumsfeld had said American soldiers were missing and that an "allied aircraft" was missing. BBC's on-the-scene reporter had a firmer grasp of events, reminding the somewhat febrile broadcaster of what had been said in Washington only moments before.  To no avail -- because no matter how good the technology becomes, users will absorb only what they are willing to take in.  In America, England, Australia -- the countries flying planes into danger -- families would have been watching the screens of televisions and computers with dread. They were taking everything in, according to the raw testimony of Nancy Chamberlin, the wife of a fallen Marine, who had told NBC anchor Tom Browkaw a day before that she deeply admired what "all of the new technology is doing today to bring it (the war) into our homes. But for the mothers and the wives who are out there watching it is murder. It's heartbreak. We can't leave the television. Every tank, every helicopter. Is that my son?" After she hung up the phone, Brokaw broke up on the air. "War is not about technology," he said. "Behind everyone one of those computer graphics, there is a life at risk," LostRemote reported.  And, indeed, as the bombers drew closer to Bagdhad, authorities there admitted there were no captured pilots. And, perhaps, no plane shot down at all.  It's difficult to lie when the cameras are on.  And the cameras are always on, these days.  Even at 50 miles-per-hour.  Spectacular footage from NBC reporter David Bloom, that has become a staple of the audience devoting its share to that network, is being made possible by a truck-sized transmision platform that keeps honed in on satellites even while rampaging across difficult terrain. The equipment is from Maritime Telecommunications Network (MTN), of Miramar, Florida, and the broadcasts must be seen to be believed.  But even though it is ALL digital, it's not all cameras.  The websites of Iraqi national television, the state news agency and the government were all still online Friday, although working poorly under what internet analysts said are huge surges in traffic. The websites appear to have been abandoned, for the most part, however, with out of date information and broken links to live feeds. By Sunday night, it was almost impossible to reach any of the Uruklink sites, and while the Iraq television spash page was easily accessible, its link to "live coverage" was broken.  The Iraqi News Agency site, part of the Uruklink system, has been in trouble for some time, if links are to be believed. It contains an outdated link to the former website of the Iraq Satellite Channel (www.iraqtv.ws) which has since been taken over by what appears to be a Christian expatriate group dedicated to the overthrow of the regime.  According to Brian McWilliams of pc-radio.com, "Web surfers have encountered intermittent problems reaching Uruklink.net, the Iraq government's main website, after the US launched its initial attack Wednesday night. But those access difficulties were apparently due to a surge of Internet visitors rather than to damage from the bombing.  "In fact, traffic to Uruklink.net is hitting record levels, according to counters at the site. The homepage of Uruklink.net had over 10,000 visits yesterday, and is on pace to hit 14,000 today. That would represent the busiest day at the site since the counter was installed in December. The previous traffic record occurred on Feb. 9, when the site's address was published in the Drudge Report."  McWilliams told Politech, a web-based newsgroup run by journalist Declan McCullagh, that the main Iraqi internet sites may only be visible to visitors from outside the country, but that the country's two mail servers were still operational and responding to ping inquiries.

Osho Zen Tarot    Trust     Don't waste your life for that which is going to be taken away. Trust life. If you trust, only then can you drop your knowledge, only then can you put your mind aside. And with trust, something immense opens up. Then this life is no longer ordinary life, it becomes full of God, overflowing.   When the heart is innocent and the walls have disappeared, you are bridged with infinity. And you are not deceived; there is nothing that can be taken away from you. That which can be taken away from you is not worth keeping, and that which cannot be taken away from you... why should one be afraid of its being taken away? It cannot be taken away, there is no possibility. You cannot lose your real treasure.  Osho The Sun Rises in the Evening Chapter 9  Commentary:  Now is the moment to be a bungee jumper without the cord! And it is this quality of absolute trust, with no reservations or secret safety nets, that the Knight of Water demands from us.   There is a tremendous sense of exhilaration if we can take the jump and move into the unknown, even if the idea scares us to death. And when we take trust to the level of the quantum leap, we don't make any elaborate plans or preparations. We don't say, "Okay, I trust that I know what to do now, and I'll settle my things and pack my suitcase and take it with me." No, we just jump, with hardly a thought for what happens next. The leap is the thing, and the thrill of it as we free-fall through the empty sky.   The card gives a hint here, though, about what waits for us at the other end - a soft, welcoming, yummy pink, rose petals, juicy...c'mon!

Ripeness     Only if your meditation has brought you a light that shines in every night will even death not be a death to you but a door to the divine. With the light in your heart, death itself is transformed into a door, and you enter into the universal spirit; you become one with the ocean. And unless you know the oceanic experience, you have lived in vain. Now is always the time, and the fruit is always ripe. You just need to gather courage to enter into your inner forest. The fruit is always ripe and the time is always the right time. There is no such thing as wrong time.  Osho A Sudden Clash of Thunder Chapter 6  Commentary:  When the fruit is ripe, it drops from the tree by itself. One moment it hangs by a thread from the branches of the tree, bursting with juice. The next moment it falls--not because it has been forced to fall, or has made the effort to jump, but because the tree has recognized its ripeness and simply let it go. When this card appears in a reading it indicates that you are ready to share your inner riches, your 'juice'. All you need to do is relax right where you are, and be willing for it to happen. This sharing of yourself, this expression of your creativity, can come in many ways--in your work, your relationships, your everyday life experiences. No special preparation or effort on your part is required. It is simply the right time.

urlLink Courage   The seed cannot know what is going to happen, the seed has never known the flower. And the seed cannot even believe that he has the potentiality to become a beautiful flower. Long is the journey, and it is always safer not to go on that journey because unknown is the path, nothing is guaranteed.   Nothing can be guaranteed. Thousand and one are the hazards of the journey, many are the pitfalls - and the seed is secure, hidden inside a hard core. But the seed tries, it makes an effort; it drops the hard shell which is its security, it starts moving. Immediately the fight starts: the struggle with the soil, with the stones, with the rocks. And the seed was very hard and the sprout will be very, very soft and dangers will be many.   There was no danger for the seed, the seed could have survived for millennia, but for the sprout many are the dangers. But the sprout starts towards the unknown, towards the sun, towards the source of light, not knowing where, not knowing why. Great is the cross to be carried, but a dream possesses the seed and the seed moves.   The same is the path for man. It is arduous. Much courage will be needed.  Osho Dang Dang Doko Dang Chapter 4  Commentary:   This card shows a small wildflower that has met the challenge of the rocks and stones in its path to emerge into the light of day. Surrounded by an aura of bright golden light, it exposes the majesty of its tiny self. Unashamed, it is equal to the brightest sun.   When we are faced with a very difficult situation we have a choice: we can either be resentful, and try to find somebody or something to blame for the hardships, or we can face the challenge and grow.   The flower shows us the way, as its passion for life leads it out of the darkness and into the light. There is no point fighting against the challenges of life, or trying to avoid or deny them. They are there, and if the seed is to become the flower we must go through them. Be courageous enough to grow into the flower you are meant to be.
urlLink Osho Zen Tarot 28. Receptivity  Receptivity    Listening is one of the basic secrets of entering into the temple of God. Listening means passivity. Listening means forgetting yourself completely - only then can you listen.   When you listen attentively to somebody, you forget yourself. If you cannot forget yourself, you never listen. If you are too self-conscious about yourself, you simply pretend that you are listening - you don't listen. You may nod your head; you may sometimes say yes and no, but you are not listening.   When you listen, you become just a passage, a passivity, a receptivity, a womb: you become feminine. And to arrive one has to become feminine. You cannot reach God as aggressive invaders, conquerors. You can reach God only...or it will be better to say God can reach you only when you are receptive, a feminine receptivity. When you become yin, a receptivity, the door is open - and you wait. Listening is the art for becoming passive.  Osho A Sudden Clash of Thunder Chapter 5  Commentary:  Receptivity represents the feminine, receptive quality of water and of the emotions. Her arms are extended upwards to receive, and she is completely immersed in the water. She has no head, no busy and aggressive mind to hinder her pure receptivity. And as she is filled she is continuously emptying herself, overflowing, and receiving more. The lotus pattern or matrix that emerges from her represents the perfect harmony of the universe that becomes apparent when we are in tune with it.   The Queen of Water brings a time of unboundedness and gratitude for whatever life brings, without any expectations or demands. Neither duty or thought of merit or reward are important. Sensitivity, intuition and compassion are the qualities that shine forth now, dissolving all the obstacles that keep us separate from each other and from the whole.

urlLink Weekly Review - May 27, 2003: Harper's Magazine  The United States and several other countries banned Canadian beef after a mad cow was discovered in Alberta. Officials were quick to point out that there was no evidence that beef from the cow, which was slaughtered in January, had entered the food chain, although they admitted that the carcass had been sent to a rendering plant and that the protein produced by the plant is sometimes used in pet food. "I want to stress from the beginning this is one cow," said the minister of agriculture. "Don't try to leave the impression that this animal went into the feed chain." Last year more than 500,000 head of cattle were exported from Alberta to the United States. Prime Minister Jean Chretien made a public show of eating a steak. SARS continued to spread in Toronto, and Britain's foreign office told travelers to avoid Taiwan because of the continuing outbreak there. The SARS virus was found in six masked palm civit cats and in a raccoon dog; SARS antibodies were also found in a Chinese ferret badger. Investigators said it was probable that the virus had jumped from one of the Chinese delicacies to humans. A new television channel devoted exclusively to SARS opened in Singapore. A British man who walked alone to the North Pole was sitting there waiting for somebody to come give him a ride home, and a 70-year-old Japanese man climbed Mount Everest. A wild turkey was found perched on a 28th-floor balcony in Manhattan.   American intelligence officials decided that two trailers found in Iraq were used to manufacture bioweapons even though they had found no evidence that the trailers were used for that purpose. Bush Administration officials claimed to have "rock-hard intelligence" that an Al Qaeda cell operating in Iran had directed the recent bombings in Saudi Arabia. Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, was asked to describe the role played by the Iranian cell; he said he knew but wasn't "going to get into it. That's for others to do." State Department officials revealed that the administration was planning to destabilize the Iranian government; others were more worried about the Al Qaeda cells in Saudi Arabia said to be plotting new attacks. American interrogators were forcing Iraqi prisoners to listen to songs by the rock band Metallica \97 as well as the "Sesame Street" theme song and the "I Love You" song by Barney the purple dinosaur \97 in order to make them talk. "These people haven't heard heavy metal. They can't take it," said one Psy Ops officer. "If you play it for 24 hours, your brain and body functions start to slide, your train of thought slows down and your will is broken. That's when we come in and talk to them." The Pentagon announced that it was changing the name of the Total Information Awareness project to "Terrorist Information Awareness." The program will search for data patterns that suggest terrorist activity; the project is also funding research into "human kinematics" and "gait recognition," apparently so that terrorists can be identified by their "walking style." It occurred to several prominent Democratic senators that the president might have deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by Iraq in order to scare people into supporting an invasion. Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican from Kansas, said he believed that weapons of mass destruction would be found, but added that "basically, you have a real credibility problem" if they are not. Former Iraqi soldiers were beginning to get restless; about 50 demonstrated in Basra and demanded that their salaries be paid by the occupiers: "If they don't pay us, we'll start problems," said one. "We have guns at home. If they don't pay us, if they make our children suffer, they'll hear from us." Members of the Arab Saraefien tribe near the Iranian border were also threatening to take up arms. "The Americans promised us food and medicine and freedom. But we have lost our homes, our land, our crops. Now we live in prison with nothing, and they ignore us," said Hadeb Hamed Hamed, the tribe's sheikh. "If we don't have a solution, we will fight the Americans even if they kill us. It is better than sitting here with nothing and just dying." In Morocco, a satirist was sentenced to four years in prison for "insulting the king" and "undermining the monarchy." The Dixie Chicks were booed at the Academy of Country Music Awards.   Christine Todd Whitman resigned as head of the Environmental Protection Agency and said that President Bush had been "hurt" by his inability to explain his environmental policies. The House of Representatives voted to exempt the Pentagon from environmental laws that protect animals such as the tidewater goby fish, the Arroyo toad, the San Diego fairy shrimp, and the coastal California gnatcatcher. Governor Jeb Bush of Florida signed a bill that could delay the restoration of the Everglades for ten years. The town of Sublimity, Oregon, was trying to sell its old unwanted water tower on Ebay. The Republican Party was selling lunch with Karl Rove, the president's political adviser, to anyone who can raise $50,000, and the Center for Public Integrity reported that Federal Communications Commission officials have taken more than two thousand trips to tourist destinations such as Las Vegas and New Orleans that were paid for by media and telecommunications companies. It was reported that Republican fund-raisers who bring in at least $200,000 for the 2004 campaign will be called "Rangers"; those who bring in $100,000 get to be called "Pioneers." The number of Christians who tithe was down 62 percent compared with last year.

urlLink Yahoo! News - Iraqis Test Newfound Press Freedoms  Mon May 19, 9:37 AM ET  Add World - AP to My Yahoo!    By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer   BAGHDAD, Iraq - On one street in the capital, a vendor shouts out news he would have been arrested for trumpeting just weeks ago: "Read all about Saddam's double!" A woman skids her car to a stop and asks for a copy of Assaah, a newspaper published in Iraq without government supervision.   Iraqis are now enjoying media freedoms unheard of in the eight decades since the nation was established by British colonialists.   During the last part of Saddam Hussein (news - web sites)'s 23-year presidency, no foreign newspapers were allowed into Iraq. Satellite dishes were banned, and cable television was prohibitively expensive. The sole windows to the outside world were radio stations like the BBC, Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo, and the U.S. government's SAWA Radio.   Since the regime was overthrown in early April, a throng of freewheeling newspapers, radio and television stations have sprung up to replace the turgid, sycophantic media under Saddam. In the days immediately following the dictatorship's collapse, the country was left without any newspapers. State-run television and radio stations went off the air.   The vacuum was quickly filled by papers published by anti-Saddam groups in northern Iraq's Kurdish areas, such as al-Itihad ("Union") and Nidaa al-Mustaqbal ("Call of the Future"), which made their way to Baghdad. The London-based Arabic-language newspaper al-Hayat became the first foreign daily to be sold in the country on April 17.   Within days, new newspapers began appearing on the streets. Three independent radio stations and several local television stations went on the air.   "It is still too early to speak about the freedom of the press," said Ali Abdel-Amir, senior editor of Nidaa al-Mustaqbal, a newspaper of the Iraqi National Accord, a longtime umbrella organization for Iraqi opposition groups.   "There is anarchy now," Abdel-Amir said. "Many of these people working in the press are not professional or objective."   The U.S.-led military coalition that occupied the country has two radio networks of its own, one run by former employees of station previously owned by Saddam's elder son, Odai. Information Radio features news announcements, Arabic music and even Western music like the occasional rendition of "The Power of Love" by Huey Lewis and the News.   Another station, Radio of the Iraqi Republic, run by former Information Ministry officials, urges listeners to forget the past and work together for a better future.   In Baghdad, viewers can tune into the coalition information channel or watch channels from neighboring Iran, primarily the Arabic-language Al-Aalam.   Ali al-Fatlawi, a reporter who worked previously for government newspapers, says working for Assaah is much better.   "There is more freedom and more openness," he said. "The red lines have been lifted, and we can express ourselves freely and without threats."
urlLink News - US post-war effort seen as on the brink of "fiasco"  "It's close to a fiasco," said Loren Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute, a Washington research organization.   "The contrasts between the efforts to rebuild Iraq and the stunning military victory could hardly be more pronounced."   Rejecting criticism that the United States failed to prepare for the post-war occupation, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has suggested that no plan could have anticipated the conditions confronting US forces.   "You couldn't know how it would end," Rumsfeld said in an interview with The New York Times published Sunday.

Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress and a great favorite of the Pentagon, warned his detractors that he had acquired about 60 tons of documents from the files of the Iraqi secret police and the Baath Party, and that the documents detailed Saddam Hussein's relations with other Arab leaders. He also threatened to shut down Al Jazeera and accused the television station's journalists of having been informants for the Iraqi government. "We will not allow this channel to continue its destructive work, which might lead to civil war in Iraq through their lies and the spreading of rumors, because rumors," Chalabi said, "are worse than killing." President Bush continued to maintain that "Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction" even as high-ranking administration officials said that they would be "amazed" if such weapons were found. Other officials suggested that actual illegal weapons might not be found and said that they were more concerned with proving that there had been a "capability" to produce them. Weapons experts working in Iraq claimed that they had found a mobile bioweapons laboratory; other military officials in Iraq were skeptical of the claim, saying the evidence was inconclusive and that no trace of such weapons had been found. "We came to bear country and we came loaded for bear," said one Defense Intelligence Agency official, "and we found that the bear was not there." Iraqi nuclear scientists warned that partially enriched uranium from the Al Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center had been taken by looters. "I saw empty uranium-oxide barrels lying around," one scientist said. "We saw people using them for milking cows and carrying drinking water." People living near giant hog factories in the United States were complaining of neurological damage from hydrogen sulfide gas and other dangerous pollutants produced by vast manure cesspools. The Environmental Protection Agency was planning to give large industrial livestock farms amnesty for violations of the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws. Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, nominated an oilman from New Mexico to be secretary of the Navy. Two American soldiers were shot dead in Iraq, and people there continued to complain about the ongoing chaos and violence of the occupation. Doctors at Baghdad's Al Rashad state mental hospital said that American soldiers had knocked down their walls with tanks and then did nothing as the hospital was looted. The sole remaining patient, an insane killer named Ali Sabah, explained that he had stayed because "I hate the world and the world hates me. I don't want the monkey to see me and I don't want to see the monkey."   Senator Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dropped his attempt to make permanent the broad surveillance powers granted the federal government by the Patriot Act, which are set to expire in 2005, and the Senate voted to expand the power of the government to spy on suspects who are not known to be associated with terrorist organizations. A German diplomat charged that the United States is turning into a police state. The National Archives announced that it was giving up its attempt to recover the famous 18-and-a-half-minute gap in President Richard Nixon's White House tapes. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy testified at his own bribery trial; he complained in an interview that he hadn't been to his house in Bermuda in three years, and said that he was the only man who could save Italy from Communism. "How much longer," he asked, "do I have to keep living this life of sacrifices?" A one-year-old boy was shot dead by Israeli soldiers as he played outside his home in the Gaza Strip. Israel was cracking down on human-rights activists, and it began to require all foreigners entering the Gaza Strip, including United Nations relief workers, to sign a waiver stating that they will not hold the Israeli army responsible if it injures or kills them. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon dismissed the American peace "roadmap" as "useless formulations that are not connected with reality." A truck bomb killed at least 29 people at a government compound in Chechnya. A new study found that violent song lyrics produce violent thoughts and emotions in listeners.   King Mohammed of Morocco released 9,459 prisoners from jail to celebrate the birth of his son, Hassan, and reduced the sentences of 38,529 others. William J. Bennett gave up gambling; Mario Cuomo, the former New York governor, said he didn't see what Bennett had done wrong and pointed out that gambling is "not among the seven great sins or even among the 70 small ones." The crew of the cargo ship Pesca Well was under investigation in Panama for possibly throwing five Dominican stowaways overboard. "This case should be a lesson for all seafaring men," said a magistrate. "Throwing people overboard is no way to solve a problem." One hundred twenty-nine passengers were sucked out of a Congolese cargo plane when its rear door opened at 33,000 feet. President Bush appeared to be irritated at criticisms of his recent Top Gun moment: "Listen," he said, "it was an honor for me to go on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln. I appreciate the chance to thank our troops. It was an unbelievably positive experience." British scientists put six Sulawesi crested macaques in a room with a computer for a month and found that the monkeys, despite their affection for the letter S, failed to produce a single word but displayed a particular interest in defecating and urinating on the keyboard. It was reported that Microsoft is developing a portable toilet equipped with Internet access. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals announced a "partial moratorium" on its boycott of Kentucky Fried Chicken, a division of Yum Brands, after the company agreed to several demands, such as putting cameras in slaughterhouses to make sure the chickens are butchered as humanely as possible. A special federal and state task force was offering grief therapy to farmers in California whose chickens and other fowl were killed to stop the spread of Exotic Newcastle Disease. Federal authorities said that they will permit passengers to take cats, dogs, and other animals, including monkeys, on airplanes for emotional support but not snakes, rodents, or spiders. Swedish authorities refused to permit a couple to name their baby "Staalman," which is Swedish for "Superman." The dollar was down against the euro. Scientists said they were very close to creating sperm.    urlLink http://www.harpers.org/weekly-review  Copyright 2003 Harper's Magazine Foundation

Why are Women Leaving Corporate America and Where are They Going? by Denise G\FCrer   urlLink http://www.cobolreport.com/columnists/denise/07292002.asp   In today\92s fast paced world, people are expected to change jobs many times and even change careers several times in their lifetime.  Even so, women are leaving corporate America at twice the rate of men.  Why are they leaving and where are they going?  Many are leaving because they are fed up with the obstacles thrown in their path solely due to their gender.  Many have seen their careers make slower progress than their male colleagues, not due to their competence but due to what has been coined as the glass ceiling.  Many need and want more autonomy and flexibility that corporate America is not willing to give.  Many simply want to be their own boss and do for themselves what they have been doing for their employers.  For all these reasons and more, large numbers of women are leaving high paying and challenging jobs to start their own businesses.  A majority of these organizations are wildly successful.  Women-owned businesses are growing more rapidly than the overall economy and becoming major contributors to the U.S. overall economic health and competitiveness.    Why Are Women Leaving? Even though women are making inroads into the executive suites of corporations, they are moving at a snail\92s pace.  The glass ceiling is still firmly in existence and holding many women back.  Thus, the first logical hypothesis would be that women are leaving to start their own companies because they have run into too many roadblocks at their current institutions.  In fact, the glass ceiling was the highest ranked reason given by a survey of women entrepreneurs (23% of respondents) (Moore and Buttner 1997).  In addition, an almost equal number of women (21%) stated that creating a work environment more consistent with their values was the main reason they started their own company.  In a different study by Catalyst, the highest ranked reasons women gave for leaving a company were lack of flexibility (51%), the glass ceiling (29%), unhappiness with the work environment (28%), and feeling unchallenged in their job (22%) (Catalyst 1998).  This suggests that women are being driven from traditional corporations due to blockades to career advancement and poor work environments.  This further suggests that these entrepreneurs are not only driven by a desire to create a viable business but to be able to make a difference in their company\92s direction and to integrate their work into their lifestyle, in other words, job autonomy, freedom, and flexibility.  In many cases, women feel they need meaningful work in order to have a fulfilling and meaningful life.  This cannot be accomplished if they are expected to fit into a niche and morph themselves into a corporate identity.    Another factor is many women feel they are undervalued.  In fact, pay equity is still a problem.  In the year 2000, women made 87 cents to every dollar a man made (Chao 2001).  More specifically, in the year 2000 women technicians earn 81.2%, computer programmers 89.6%, engineers 84.3%, mathematical and computer scientists 85.4%, and natural scientists 72.1% of what their male counterparts earn (USDoL 2001).  Another interesting statistic is married women with children (less than 18 years old) make 96.2% of their female counterparts who do not have children.  However there is virtually no difference in pay (99.3%) between married men with children and married men with no children.  This discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that mothers still take on a larger burden of care for their children than the fathers and this affects their careers.  To counteract this problem, women need support and flexibility for balancing work and family so they can be 100% productive in both.  Many view this support as something the company should provide.  When the company does not come through, women perceive this as a key contributor to a poor working environment and opt to start their own business where they have more control over such factors.  How Can Corporations Reverse This Trend? In today\92s knowledge based economy the loss of high-level women in corporations is a loss in intellectual capital, knowledge, and connections.  The loss of good people also precipitates low morale and uncertainty among the staff and incurs the cost of recruiting, hiring, and training replacements.  All of this can be avoided in many cases through low cost and innovative programs and changes to the work culture and environment (Donahue 1998).    A corporation\92s first step is to determine why women are leaving their company in particular.  This could involve obtaining feedback from the employees through interviews or surveys (with a guarantee of confidentiality) and directed questions in exit interviews.  Statistics must be gathered to understand the extent of the problem.  These could include the numbers of women and men entering and leaving the company at different levels, the promotion rate for women and men, the percentage of women in higher management position and where those positions are located (e.g., engineering vs. human resources), and relative salaries grouped by experience, reviews, responsibilities, and other criteria.  Gender inequity issues should be openly discussed without fear of repercussion.  In particular, discussions could center around whether the performance standards are objective and appropriate, whether women are visible enough (or at all) in highly respected positions, the identification of male only traditions, and how mentoring is and should be conducted within the company.    It is only when the key problem areas are identified that initial steps can be taken to correct them.  Based on this \93research\94, goals and solutions to these problems must be formulated and mapped out and then finally implemented.  It is crucial that the company, all the way up to the executive office, is fully supportive of this effort.  Managers must be held responsible for implementing the procedures and meeting the defined goals for gender equity.    Some example activities are: being proactive in identifying high potential women and providing mentoring and support for their upward career movement; making the higher ranking women more visible to the rest of the company; ensuring job searches include qualified women candidates; and providing flexibility in the workplace through flextime, onsite or supported childcare, and telecommuting.   Women tend to learn more from other people in the company than their male counterparts (Van Velsor and Hughes 1990).  Thus, mentoring and executive development are crucial for the upward movement and retention of women in the organization.  Another key factor that professional women state over and over again for leaving a company is they felt underutilized and undervalued.  This is in large part due to the necessity of constantly proving their competence because they are different from the one good model (i.e., male).  Other models that fit women management styles should be accepted and encouraged throughout the corporation.    Essentially the bottom line is: why should women devote all their efforts to fit into an unfriendly culture when they can leave and start their own business?  If business organizations are genuinely concerned about this loss of talent, they must immediately start making changes to their culture and be proactive about the recruitment and retention of women.  Given the move towards a global economy and need for more diversity, corporations cannot afford to ignore the large pool of talented professional women.  Characteristics and Culture of Women Owned Businesses Starting a company is a difficult road, fraught with hurdles, setbacks, and barriers.  However, the professional women who are starting their own businesses are finding that they enjoy the empowerment, excitement, and flexibility.  They are doing things their way, implementing their ideas and management styles.    For high tech businesses, the majority of women-owned firms are in the biotechnology industry (46%) with 29% in information technology.  Just the opposite is true for men with 47% in information technology and 33% in biotechnology (NFWBO 2001b).  This follows current trends in bachelor degree awards in the U.S.  The most recent statistics from the Department of Education show women graduates at 58.3% of B.S. graduates in biological and life sciences and only 28.1% in computer and information science (NCES 2001).   No matter what the business area is, women bring a different management style and culture to the table.  NFWBO found that 53% of women business owners emphasize \93right-brain\94 thinking (creativity and values-based decision making), while the majority of male business owners (71%) stress left-brain thinking such as methodological and procedural analysis (NFWBO 1994).  The same study found that two-thirds of women business owners tended to weigh options and reflect internally before decision making more so than their male counterparts (66% vs. 56%), who tended to emphasize action and give more attention to external events.    The attributes of a company\92s leadership have a strong effect on the culture of the workplace.  Women entrepreneurs are more likely to describe their workplace in \93family\94 terms and work within a network of business relationships.  Men entrepreneurs, on the other hand, tend to think more in hierarchical terms and focus on establishing clear rules and procedures (NFWBO 1994; G\FCrer 2001).  The NFWBO study also found that in addition to monetary gain, women tend to derive success from building relationships with customers and employees and having control over their own destiny.  Men on the other hand, derive success from the satisfaction of a job well done and achieving desired goals.  Thus, women\92s leadership approaches are more likely to bring about an environment that is a \93web of inclusion\94 (see G\FCrer 2001; Helgesen 1995), while men\92s leadership is more likely to encourage hierarchical organizations with a top down approach.   Another characteristic of women owned businesses is that they are more likely to offer environments that help provide balance in their employees\92 lives through programs such as flextime, tuition reimbursement, and job sharing.  Only 30% of small businesses (less than 25 employees) offer flextime, while 40% of women owned small businesses do.  For large businesses (greater than 25 employees), 40% of women-owned firms provide flextime as compared to only 19% of all large firms (NFWBO 1994).  In addition, 21% of women-owned small businesses offer tuition reimbursement programs, as compared to only 8% of all small businesses.    Diversity is another factor that can be affected by company leadership.  Not surprisingly, women-owned firms tend to employ a more gender-balanced workforce.  Women-owned businesses employ half women and half men (52% women and 48% men).  Men-owned firms, on the other hand, employ only 38% women and 62% men (NFWBO 2000a).    The Success of Women-Owned Businesses From an economic viewpoint, women owned businesses are quite successful.  In 1999, women-owned businesses numbered at 9.1 million, employed over 27.5 million people, and generated over $3.6 trillion in sales (NFWBO 1999).  Of these businesses established in the last decade, the average earns $500,000 or more in revenue.  These businesses are also financially stable.  Women owned firms are as likely to pay bills on time and are as financially sound as all U.S. firms (CWBR 1995).  Businesses owned by women are the most rapidly expanding sector of the economy.  The growth in the number of women-owned firms, employment, and revenue exceeded the rate of growth of all businesses in 1997 (USCB 1997).  From 1987 to 1999, the number of women-owned firms increased by 103%, employment grew by 320%, and sales shot up by 436%.  With respect to high tech firms, a higher percentage of women-owned high tech firms are fast growing than men-owned firms, 48% vs. 28% (NFWBO 2001a), although women-owned firms are in the minority in the high tech sector.    Still Some Difficulties Even though women-owned firms on average are very successful, there are still obstacles faced due to gender.  One key difficulty is most women owners of fast-growth firms are less likely to have entrepreneurial mentors or role models, past experience in owning a business, or an executive professional background.  These are all crucial in assisting the entrepreneur along the path of success.    Women entrepreneurs of fast growth firms have to depend more on personal debt and business earnings for financing than their male colleagues.  Only 39% of women-owned firms have a commercial bank loan vs. 52% of men-owned firms.  In addition, equity capital for women-owned businesses typically comes from informal investors such as family members and individual \93angel\94 investors (73%) with only 15% from venture capital firms (NFWBO 2000b).  Women owners of fast-growth firms are also less likely to share ownership of their firms with outside investors (28% for women vs. 49% for men) (NFWBO 2001b).  This reliance on personal and informal debt is holding women-owned firms back since high growth depends in large part to being able to leverage debt and equity.    Given these factors, it is crucial that women are given access to entrepreneurship information and mentoring in order to succeed.  There are currently programs that strive towards these goals \96 many of which can be linked to via the Center for Women's Business Research\92s website at http://www.nfwbo.org  Catalyst for Change? The management style, work culture, and employee benefits offered by women-owned companies not only provide for powerful economic forces, but are influential social forces as well.  Interestingly, the concerns of women in the workplace are also starting to apply to men as well.  A recent survey of technology professionals by Webgrrls, in western New York, found that both men and women were experiencing an imbalance between their work and home life (38% of respondents) (Drury 2001).  Men are now beginning to demand more of a balance between their personal and work life.  In addition, men are taking more of a role in raising their children and other nontraditional male at-home responsibilities.  It is now possible to find stay-at-home dads where the mom is the sole source of income for the family.  However, it is still the majority of women who are concerned with work/life balance and quality of work environments.  The Webgrrls survey found 76% of women feel their work environment is very important versus 51% of men.  Even so, there is a substantial number of men who are starting to realize they want to spend more time outside of work and that a pleasant productive work environment is important.  As the workforce and business leadership become more diverse and markets become more global, the workplace culture is slowly evolving.  The tides of change are coming for more flexible and family or people-friendly workplaces.  Regardless of the effect on workplace environments, it is clear that more and more businesses are being created and run by women.  These businesses are largely successful and it is not too wild of a speculation to state that the women-owned businesses of today will become the Fortune 500 companies of the future.

Alert: Total Lunar Eclipse Set Thursday  AP to My Yahoo!   LOS ANGELES - If the weather cooperates, a total lunar eclipse will be seen across North America late Thursday \97 the first visible in the United States in three years \97 and just before dawn Friday in western Europe and western and southern Africa.   A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth casts its shadow on the full moon, blocking the sunlight that otherwise reflects off the moon's surface. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye.   In North America, the moon will remain totally eclipsed for 53 minutes, and should turn substantially darker and reddish in color.   The total eclipse will start at 8:13 PDT in Los Angeles, 11:13 p.m. EDT in New York. A second lunar eclipse, on Nov. 8, will be visible from North and South America.   Eclipses once helped prove the Earth is round, because its shadow on the moon is curved.

Shining true being: Meditation for the Dying  Imagine that your body no longer has the strength, the energy, to maintain its connection with the life-force, with the body of awareness within. And imagine now that you are beginning to experience the process of dissolving out of that body. Sensations from the body no longer so distinct, melting away, leaving just a spaciousness. Dissolving out of the body. Leaving that heavier form behind. Dissolving into consciousness itself.  My friend, listen now, for that which is called death has arrived. So let go gently, gently, of all that holds you back. Of all that pulls you away from this most precious moment. Know that now you have arrived at the transition called death. Open to it. Let go into it.   Recognise the changing experience of the mind as it separates from the body, dissolving.   Dissolving now into the realms of pure light. Your true nature shining everywhere before you.   My friend, maintain an open-heartedness, a spaciousness of being that does not grasp. Let things be as they are without the least attempt to interfere. Grasping at nothing.   Enter the essential nature of your own being shining there before you, a great luminosity. Rest in being. Knowing it for what it is. This light shining, luminous. Your true self.   Let go, gently, gently, without the least force. Before you shines your true being. It is without birth, without death.   Let go of all which distracts or confuses the mind, all that created density in life.   Go gently into it. Do not be frightened or bewildered. Do not pull back in fear from the immensity of your true being. Now is a moment for liberation.   Know that you are well guided by your compassion and love. You are the essence of all things. You are the light.   From 'Who Dies?' by Stephen Levine.
For Each of You  Be who you are and will be learn to cherish that boistrous Black Angel that drives you up one day and down another protecting the place where your power rises running like hot blood from the same source as your pain.  When you are hungry learn to eat whatever sustains you until morning but do not be misled by details simply because you live them.  Do not let your head deny your hands any memory of what passes through them nor your eyes nor your heart everything can be useful except what is wasteful (you will need  to remember this when you are accused of destruction.) Even when they are dangerous examine the heart of those machines you hate before you discard them and never mourn the lack of their power lest you be condemned to relive them. If you do not learn to hate you will never be lonely  enough to love easily nor will you always be brave although it does not grow any easier  Do not pretend to convenient beliefs even when they are righteous you will never be able to defend your city while shouting.  Remember our sun is not the most noteworthy star only the nearest.

urlLink Researchers create flexible, paper-thin electronic screen  Associated Press  In a step toward electronic newspapers and wearable computer screens, scientists have created an ultra-thin screen that can be bent, twisted and even rolled up and still display crisp text.  The material, only as thick as three human hairs, displays black text on a whitish-gray background with a resolution similar to that of a typical laptop computer screen.  The screen is so flexible it can be rolled into a cylinder about a half-inch wide without losing its image quality.  Although it's not quite the dream of single-sheet, electronic newspapers or books that can display hundreds of pages of text, its creators said it's the first flexible computer screen of its kind.  ``I think it's a major step forward. We have cleared a big obstacle in electronic paper development,'' said Yu Chen, a research scientist with E Ink Corp. of Cambridge, Mass.  E Ink is one of several companies working to develop electronic ``paper'' for e-newspapers and e-books, and other possible applications -- even clothing with computer screens sewn into it.  The new screen is described in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.  Aris Silzars, the past president of the San Jose, Calif.-based Society for Information Display, said one of the technology's first applications could be something like an electronic tablet lawyers could use in place of bulky laptops.  But Silzars said the best uses of the new screen, which E Ink is still developing, may not be evident. ``It's very hard to predict where this thing may go,'' he said.  Chen and his co-workers made the 3-inch wide display screen flexible by developing a stainless steel foil topped with a thin layer of circuits that control an overlying film of electronic ink.  That ``ink,'' developed in 1997 by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, contains tiny capsules with black and white particles with opposing electrical charges floating in a clear fluid.  When a negative voltage is run through circuits behind these capsules, the positive white particles move to the capsule's top. A positive current does the same to the negative black particles.  The human eye blends these resulting patterns of black- or white-topped capsules into text displayed in a traditional column.  Currently, information and power is fed to the screen through a wired hookup. But Chen's team is working on a self-contained system that could receive data through a wireless connection.  They also hope to boost the speed at which the screen switches to a new ``page'' of text, from the current quarter of a second to at least 10 times as fast, so it can display video.  Another goal is making the screen display a full range of colors.  Robert Wisnieff, senior manager of IBM Corp.'s Advanced Display Technology Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., said E Ink's flexible screen is something many futurists believe is crucial to making electronic screens part of every day life.  He envisions such lightweight, thin screens being used for a credit card that could display the available balance or recent purchases.  Another possible use is a jacket with a screen sewn into its sleeve to allow its wearer to read e-mail while on the run, check stock prices or access maps in an unfamiliar city.  ``This is a peek at the future,'' Wisnieff said.

urlLink Inner Voice  If you have found your truth within yourself there is nothing more in this whole existence to find. Truth is functioning through you. When you open your eyes, it is truth opening his eyes. When you close your eyes, it is truth who is closing its eyes.   This is a tremendous meditation. If you can simply understand the device, you don't have to do anything; whatever you are doing is being done by truth. You are walking, it is truth; you are sleeping, it is truth resting; you are speaking, it is truth speaking; you are silent, it is truth that is silent.   This is one of the most simple meditation techniques. Slowly, slowly everything settles by this simple formula, and then there is no need for the technique. When you are cured, you throw away the meditation, you throw away the medicine. Then you live as truth - alive, radiant, contented, blissful, a song unto yourself. Your whole life becomes a prayer without any words, or better to say a prayerfulness, a grace, a beauty which does not belong to our mundane world, a ray of light coming from the beyond into the darkness of our world.  Osho The Great Zen Master Ta Hui Chapter 23  Commentary:  The Inner Voice speaks not in words but in the wordless language of the heart. It is like an oracle who only speaks the truth. If it had a face, it would be like the face at the center of this card - alert, watchful, and able to accept both the dark and the light, symbolized by the two hands holding the crystal. The crystal itself represents the clarity that comes from transcending all dualities.   The Inner Voice can also be playful, as it dives deep into the emotions and emerges again to soar towards the sky, like two dolphins dancing in the waters of life. It is connected with the cosmos, through the crescent-moon crown, and the earth, as represented by the green leaves on the figure's kimono.   There are times in our lives when too many voices seem to be pulling us this way and that. Our very confusion in such situations is a reminder to seek silence and centering within. Only then are we able to hear our truth.

A suicide bomber, who turned out to be a British citizen, responded to the confirmation of Mahmoud Abbas as prime minister by blowing up a nightclub in Tel Aviv, leaving body parts scattered along the shore. A day later Israeli tanks invaded a crowded neighborhood in Gaza and killed 12 Palestinians, mostly civilians, including two-year-old boy, in a hunt for a Hamas weapons smuggler. UNICEF reported that since the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada 92 Israeli and 436 Palestinian children have been killed. American soldiers shot and killed 15 Iraqi civilians who were demonstrating against the occupation on Saddam Hussein's birthday; a few days later another demonstration was held to protest the killings, and soldiers shot a few more. Anonymous Bush Administration officials were beginning to speak more candidly about the president\92s rationale for invading Iraq, saying that Iraq's potential as a military threat was less important than its strategic location and the president's desire to make a "global showoff American power and democracy." Officials continued to play down the possibility that any significant weapons of mass destruction would be found in Iraq; one senior Whitehouse source speculated that what might turn up were some\94 precursors," and said that Saddam Hussein "couldn't put them together as long as the inspections were going on.\94 President Bush landed on an aircraft carrier in an S-3BViking airplane and, clad in a military jumpsuit with the words "Commander in Chief" printed on the back, he informed the assembled sailors, whom he said were "the best of our country," that the war on Iraq had been won. The commander in chief, who served as a pilot in the Texas National Guard during the Vietnam War, told reporters that he had briefly flown the airplane. "I miss flying," he said. Few publications mentioned the president's long unexplained failure to report for duty during that period, and his daring arrival was widely hailed as a "Top Gun moment." NBCofficials confirmed that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman will both appear on a future episode of "Friends."   William J. Bennett, the author of "The Book of Virtues," "The Death of Outrage," and "The Moral Compass," among other books, was revealed to be a high-stakes gambler who has blown up to$8 million over the last decade playing high-limit slot machines and video poker. Bennett acknowledged that he has never condemned the vice of gambling. Somebody tried to shoot Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela.

urlLink Desiderata   Go placidly amid the noise and haste And remember what peace there may be in silence.  As far as possible without surrender,  Be on good terms with all persons.  Speak your truth quietly and clearly and listen to others,  Even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons;  They are vexatious to the spirit.   If you compare yourself with others you may become vain or bitter,  For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.  Keep interested in your career, however humble;  It is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.   Exercise caution in your business affairs,  For the world is full of trickery But let this not blind you to what virtue there is.  Many persons strive for high ideals  And everywhere life is full of heroism.   Be yourself.  Especially do not feign affection, Neither be cynical about love,  For in the face of all aridity and disappointment  It is as perennial as the grass.   Take kindly the counsel of the years,  Gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.  But do not distress yourself with imaginings.  Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.   Beyond a wholesome discipline be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars.  You have a right to be here. And whether it is clear to you or not,  No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God,  Whatever you conceive him to be,  And whatever your labours and aspirations in the noisy confusion of life,  Keep peace with your soul.   With all its sham and drudgery and broken dreams  It is still a beautiful world.  Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.   Max Ehrman, 1927 Found in Old Saint Paul's Church, Baltimore, U.S.A. Dated 1692

Harmony by Osho    Listen to your heart, move according to your heart, whatsoever the stake: A condition of complete simplicity costing not less than everything.... To be simple is arduous, because to be simple costs everything that you have. You have to lose all to be simple.That's why people have chosen to be complex and they have forgotten how to be simple. But only a simple heart throbs with God, hand in hand. Only a simple heart sings with God in deep harmony. To reach to that point you will have to find your heart, your own throb, your own beat.  Osho Dang Dang Doko Dang Chapter 3  Commentary: The experience of resting in the heart in meditation is not something that can be grasped or forced. It comes naturally, as we grow more and more in tune with the rhythms of our own inner silences. The figure on this card reflects the sweetness and delicacy of this experience. The dolphins that emerge from the heart and make an arc towards the third eye reflect the playfulness and intelligence that comes when we are able to connect with the heart and move into the world from there. Let yourself be softer and more receptive now, because an inexpressible joy is waiting for you just around the corner. Nobody else can point it out to you, and when you find it you won't be able to find the words to express it to others. But it's there, deep within your heart, ripe and ready to be discovered.

urlLink http://www.enneagramcentral.com/   Style Four : Fours are about authenticity. Fours have a deep and wide range of emotions and trust their subjective experience to make their life-decisions. They are frequently highly esthetic (not in talent, necessarily, but in concern), because they have a highly developed ability to think symbolically. This coupled with their emotional richness cries out for artistic expression.  Fours make a personal statement in many things they do, from the way they dress to their choice of Impressionist paintings. They rather enjoy not being part of the crowd and have a natural sense of aristocracy. Taste, they maintain, is not determined by votes. When they are less healthy, their speech becomes lamentation as they claim their uniqueness because of their suffering. They often develop a spirit of entitlement to compensate for a feeling that somehow they are defective. This defect, paradoxically, is the basis for their claim that they deserve love. They make a claim on their friends' love because they have suffered and this suffering has made them more authentic - and so more lovable.  Fours you may know: Shakespeare, Dennis Rodman, Nicholas Cage, Marlon Brando, Ann Rice, (Vampires are depicted as Fours), Kate Winslet, Vincent van Gogh, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, John Malkovich, Thomas Merton, and Allen Watts.   urlLink http://tap3x.net/EMBTI/journal.html  - More Personality Tests

urlLink Who Am I? - (Nan Yar?)   As all living beings desire to be happy always, without misery, as in the case of everyone there is observed supreme love for one's self, and as happiness alone is the cause for love, in order to gain that happiness which is one's nature and which is experienced in the state of deep sleep where there is no mind, one should know one's self. For that, the path of knowledge, the inquiry of the form "Who am I?", is the principal means.    1 . Who am I ? The gross body which is composed of the seven humours (dhatus), I am not; the five cognitive sense organs, viz. the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell, which apprehend their respective objects, viz. sound, touch, colour, taste, and odour, I am not; the five cognitive sense-organs, viz. the organs of speech, locomotion, grasping, excretion, and procreation, which have as their respective functions speaking, moving, grasping, excreting, and enjoying, I am not; the five vital airs, prana, etc., which perform respectively the five functions of in-breathing, etc., I am not; even the mind which thinks, I am not; the nescience too, which is endowed only with the residual impressions of objects, and in which there are no objects and no functioning's, I am not.   2. If I am none of these, then who am I? After negating all of the above-mentioned as 'not this', 'not this', that Awareness which alone remains - that I am.   3. What is the nature of Awareness? The nature of Awareness is existence-consciousness-bliss   4. When will the realization of the Self be gained? When the world which is what-is-seen has been removed, there will be realization of the Self which is the seer.   5. Will there not be realization of the Self even while the world is there (taken as real)? There will not be.   6. Why? The seer and the object seen are like the rope and the snake. Just as the knowledge of the rope which is the substrate will not arise unless the false knowledge of the illusory serpent goes, so the realization of the Self which is the substrate will not be gained unless the belief that the world is real is removed.   7. When will the world which is the object seen be removed? When the mind, which is the cause of all cognition's and of all actions, becomes quiescent, the world will disappear.   8. What is the nature of the mind? What is called 'mind' is a wondrous power residing in the Self. It causes all thoughts to arise. Apart from thoughts, there is no such thing as mind. Therefore, thought is the nature of mind. Apart from thoughts, there is no independent entity called the world. In deep sleep there are no thoughts, and there is no world. In the states of waking and dream, there are thoughts, and there is a world also. Just as the spider emits the thread (of the web) out of itself and again withdraws it into itself, likewise the mind projects the world out of itself and again resolves it into itself. When the mind comes out of the Self, the world appears. Therefore, when the world appears (to be real), the Self does not appear; and when the Self appears (shines) the world does not appear. When one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the Self (as the residue). What is referred to as the Self is the Atman. The mind always exists only in dependence on something gross; it cannot stay alone. It is the mind that is called the subtle body or the soul (jiva).   9. What is the path of inquiry for understanding the nature of the mind? That which rises as 'I' in this body is the mind. If one inquires as to where in the body the thought 'I' rises first, one would discover that it rises in the heart. That is the place of the mind's origin. Even if one thinks constantly 'I' 'I', one will be led to that place. Of all the thoughts that arise in the mind, the 'I' thought is the first. It is only after the rise of this that the other thoughts arise. It is after the appearance of the first personal pronoun that the second and third personal pronouns appear; without the first personal pronoun there will not be the second and third.   10. How will the mind become quiescent? By the inquiry 'Who am I?'. The thought 'who am I?' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. Then, there will arise Self-realization.   11. What is the means for constantly holding on to the thought 'Who am I?' When other thoughts arise, one should not pursue them, but should inquire: 'To whom do they arise?' It does not matter how many thoughts arise. As each thought arises, one should inquire with diligence, "To whom has this thought arisen?". The answer that would emerge would be "To me". Thereupon if one inquires "Who am I?", the mind will go back to its source; and the thought that arose will become quiescent. With repeated practice in this manner, the mind will develop the skill to stay in its source. When the mind that is subtle goes out through the brain and the sense-organs, the gross names and forms appear; when it stays in the heart, the names and forms disappear. Not letting the mind go out, but retaining it in the Heart is what is called "inwardness" (antar-mukha). Letting the mind go out of the Heart is known as "externalisation" (bahir-mukha). Thus, when the mind stays in the Heart, the 'I' which is the source of all thoughts will go, and the Self which ever exists will shine. Whatever one does, one should do without the egoity "I". If one acts in that way, all will appear as of the nature of Siva (God).   12. Are there no other means for making the mind quiescent? Other than inquiry, there are no adequate means. If through other means it is sought to control the mind, the mind will appear to be controlled, but will again go forth. Through the control of breath also, the mind will become quiescent; but it will be quiescent only so long as the breath remains controlled, and when the breath resumes the mind also will again start moving and will wander as impelled by residual impressions. The source is the same for both mind and breath. Thought, indeed, is the nature of the mind. The thought "I" is the first thought of the mind; and that is egoity. It is from that whence egoity originates that breath also originates. Therefore, when the mind becomes quiescent, the breath is controlled, and when the breath is controlled the mind becomes quiescent. But in deep sleep, although the mind becomes quiescent, the breath does not stop. This is because of the will of God, so that the body may be preserved and other people may not be under the impression that it is dead. In the state of waking and in samadhi, when the mind becomes quiescent the breath is controlled. Breath is the gross form of mind. Till the time of death, the mind keeps breath in the body; and when the body dies the mind takes the breath along with it. Therefore, the exercise of breath-control is only an aid for rendering the mind quiescent (manonigraha); it will not destroy the mind (manonasa). Like the practice of breath-control. meditation on the forms of God, repetition of mantras, restriction on food, etc., are but aids for rendering the mind quiescent.   Through meditation on the forms of God and through repetition of mantras, the mind becomes one-pointed. The mind will always be wandering. Just as when a chain is given to an elephant to hold in its trunk it will go along grasping the chain and nothing else, so also when the mind is occupied with a name or form it will grasp that alone. When the mind expands in the form of countless thoughts, each thought becomes weak; but as thoughts get resolved the mind becomes one-pointed and strong; for such a mind Self-inquiry will become easy. Of all the restrictive rules, that relating to the taking of sattvic food in moderate quantities is the best; by observing this rule, the sattvic quality of mind will increase, and that will be helpful to Self-inquiry.   13. The residual impressions (thoughts) of objects appear wending like the waves of an ocean. When will all of them get destroyed? As the meditation on the Self rises higher and higher, the thoughts will get destroyed.   14. Is it possible for the residual impressions of objects that come from beginningless time, as it were, to be resolved, and for one to remain as the pure Self? Without yielding to the doubt "Is it possible, or not?", one should persistently hold on to the meditation on the Self. Even if one be a great sinner, one should not worry and weep "O! I am a sinner, how can I be saved?"; one should completely renounce the thought "I am a sinner"; and concentrate keenly on meditation on the Self; then, one would surely succeed. There are not two minds - one good and the other evil; the mind is only one. It is the residual impressions that are of two kinds - auspicious and inauspicious. When the mind is under the influence of auspicious impressions it is called good; and when it is under the influence of inauspicious impressions it is regarded as evil. The mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects and what concerns other people. However bad other people may be, one should bear no hatred for them. Both desire and hatred should be eschewed. All that one gives to others one gives to one's self. If this truth is understood who will not give to others? When one's self arises all arises; when one's self becomes quiescent all becomes quiescent. To the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result good. If the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere.   15. How long should inquiry be practised? As long as there are impressions of objects in the mind, so long the inquiry "Who am I?" is required. As thoughts arise they should be destroyed then and there in the very place of their origin, through inquiry. If one resorts to contemplation of the Self unintermittently, until the Self is gained, that alone would do. As long as there are enemies within the fortress, they will continue to sally forth; if they are destroyed as they emerge, the fortress will fall into our hands.   16. What is the nature of the Self? What exists in truth is the Self alone. The world, the individual soul, and God are appearances in it. like silver in mother-of-pearl, these three appear at the same time, and disappear at the same time. The Self is that where there is absolutely no "I" thought. That is called "Silence". The Self itself is the world; the Self itself is "I"; the Self itself is God; all is Siva, the Self.   17. Is not everything the work of God? Without desire, resolve, or effort, the sun rises; and in its mere presence, the sun-stone emits fire, the lotus blooms, water evaporates; people perform their various functions and then rest. Just as in the presence of the magnet the needle moves, it is by virtue of the mere presence of God that the souls governed by the three (cosmic) functions or the fivefold divine activity perform their actions and then rest, in accordance with their respective karmas. God has no resolve; no karma attaches itself to Him. That is like worldly actions not affecting the sun, or like the merits and demerits of the other four elements not affecting all pervading space.   18. Of the devotees, who is the greatest? He who gives himself up to the Self that is God is the most excellent devotee. Giving one's self up to God means remaining constantly in the Self without giving room for the rise of any thoughts other than that of the Self. Whatever burdens are thrown on God, He bears them. Since the supreme power of God makes all things move, why should we, without submitting ourselves to it, constantly worry ourselves with thoughts as to what should be done and how, and what should not be done and how not? We know that the train carries all loads, so after getting on it why should we carry our small luggage on our head to our discomfort, instead of putting it down in the train and feeling at ease?   19. What is non-attachment? As thoughts arise, destroying them utterly without any residue in the very place of their origin is non-attachment. Just as the pearl-diver ties a stone to his waist, sinks to the bottom of the sea and there takes the pearls, so each one of us should be endowed with non-attachment, dive within oneself and obtain the Self-Pearl.   20. Is it not possible for God and the Guru to effect the release of a soul? God and the Guru will only show the way to release; they will not by themselves take the soul to the state of release. In truth, God and the Guru are not different. Just as the prey which has fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so those who have come within the ambit of the Guru's gracious look will be saved by the Guru and will not get lost; yet, each one should by his own effort pursue the path shown by God or Guru and gain release. One can know oneself only with one's own eye of knowledge, and not with somebody else's. Does he who is Rama require the help of a mirror to know that he is Rama?   21. Is it necessary for one who longs for release to inquire into the nature of categories (tattvas)? Just as one who wants to throw away garbage has no need to analyse it and see what it is, so one who wants to know the Self has no need to count the number of categories or inquire into their characteristics; what he has to do is to reject altogether the categories that hide the Self. The world should be considered like a dream.   22. Is there no difference between waking and dream? Waking is long and a dream short; other than this there is no difference. Just as waking happenings seem real while awake. so do those in a dream while dreaming. In dream the mind takes on another body. In both waking and dream states thoughts. names and forms occur simultaneously.   23. Is it any use reading books for those who long for release? All the texts say that in order to gain release one should render the mind quiescent; therefore their conclusive teaching is that the mind should be rendered quiescent; once this has been understood there is no need for endless reading. In order to quieten the mind one has only to inquire within oneself what one's Self is; how could this search be done in books? One should know one's Self with one's own eye of wisdom. The Self is within the five sheaths; but books are outside them. Since the Self has to be inquired into by discarding the five sheaths, it is futile to search for it in books. There will come a time when one will have to forget all that one has learned.   24. What is happiness? Happiness is the very nature of the Self; happiness and the Self are not different. There is no happiness in any object of the world. We imagine through our ignorance that we derive happiness from objects. When the mind goes out, it experiences misery. In truth, when its desires are fulfilled, it returns to its own place and enjoys the happiness that is the Self. Similarly, in the states of sleep, samadhi and fainting, and when the object desired is obtained or the object disliked is removed, the mind becomes inward-turned, and enjoys pure Self-Happiness. Thus the mind moves without rest alternately going out of the Self and returning to it. Under the tree the shade is pleasant; out in the open the heat is scorching. A person who has been going about in the sun feels cool when he reaches the shade. Someone who keeps on going from the shade into the sun and then back into the shade is a fool. A wise man stays permanently in the shade. Similarly, the mind of the one who knows the truth does not leave Brahman. The mind of the ignorant, on the contrary, revolves in the world, feeling miserable, and for a little time returns to Brahman to experience happiness. In fact, what is called the world is only thought. When the world disappears, i.e. when there is no thought, the mind experiences happiness; and when the world appears, it goes through misery.   25. What is wisdom-insight (jnana-drsti)? Remaining quiet is what is called wisdom-insight. To remain quiet is to resolve the mind in the Self. Telepathy, knowing past, present and future happenings and clairvoyance do not constitute wisdom-insight.   26. What is the relation between desirelessness and wisdom? Desirelessness is wisdom. The two are not different; they are the same. Desirelessness is refraining from turning the mind towards any object. Wisdom means the appearance of no object. In other words, not seeking what is other than the Self is detachment or desirelessness; not leaving the Self is wisdom.   27. What is the difference between inquiry and meditation? Inquiry consists in retaining the mind in the Self. Meditation consists in thinking that one's self is Brahman, existence-consciousness-bliss.   28. What is release? Inquiring into the nature of one's self that is in bondage, and realising one's true nature is release.   SRI RAMANARPANAM ASTU

urlLink BBC NEWS | South Asia | Sanskrit struggles to survive  Monday, 5 August, 2002, 12:51 GMT 13:51 UK  Students say Sanskrit offers no job prospects  By Sanjeev Srivastava  BBC correspondent in Bombay    One of the oldest languages in the world, Sanskrit, is in danger of becoming extinct in India, the country of its origin.   Although most Indian languages still use the basic grammar of Sanskrit, no more than a few thousand people in a country of more than one billion can claim to read, write and speak it fluently.   What was once the language of the elite in ancient India, Sanskrit no longer enjoys the exalted status it once had.   Poor job prospects   In Bombay's Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, one of the city's oldest and biggest education institutions. students recite Sanskrit shlokas.   We, at our own level, want to be refined, to be cultured, to be a better person and this is here, we need Sanskrit    Sanskrit scholar Girish Jani   Only 150 students come here to learn this ancient language - a very small number if you compare it with the tens of thousands of students who go out every day to the city's schools and colleges.   So why are so few students coming to learn Sanskrit?   The school's principal, Narendra Kumar Singh says there are very few jobs for anyone studying Sanskrit.    Some get jobs as priests   "At most, they can become a teacher in Sanskrit schools, Sanskrit colleges so their salaries are also very meagre."   "The other opportunity for them is to perform [religious] rituals for some rich people," he added.   Lacking relevance?   The other reason why Sanskrit is losing out is because it was never really the language of the masses.   It was the language of the elite used for correspondence amongst royalty and for composing classic prose and poetry.   There are some who opt for Sanskrit because it is regarded as a subject in which one can get high grades and can help improve one's overall grades.   But most students learn the language to know about the past. Some study Sanskrit to improve their grades. There is a school of thought which believes that teaching and learning Sanskrit is a complete waste of time and resources, especially as most Sanskrit colleges are publicly funded.   Critics of Sanskrit say government-funded colleges should be preparing students for the real world and offer only vocational and employment-oriented courses.   However, Sanskrit scholars like Girish Jani rubbish this approach.   "Why should we read Shakespeare? Why should we read Sartre? Are they connected really with the life in the first attempt? No.   "We, at our own level, want to be refined, to be cultured, to be a better person and this is here, we need Sanskrit."   Scholars like Mr Jani do have a point and there is logic in their argument about Sanskrit being a language of cultural refinement,   But the sad reality is that Sanskrit is fighting a losing battle in the country of its origin.
urlLink NASA researcher, Rick Briggs has written:   "In ancient India the intention to discover truth was so consuming, that in the process, they discovered perhaps the most perfect tool for fulfilling such a search that the world has ever known -- the Sanskrit language. There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own. Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigor until the present century. Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence. This article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in AI has been reinventing a wheel millennia old.  The discovery is of monumental significance. It is mind-boggling to consider that we have available to us a language which has been spoken for 4-7000 years that appears to be in every respect a perfect language designed for enlightened communication. But the most stunning aspect of the discovery is this: NASA the most advanced research center in the world for cutting edge technology has discovered that Sanskrit, the world's oldest spiritual language is the only unambiguous spoken language on the planet. Considering Sanskrit's status as a spiritual language, a further implication of this discovery is that the age old dichotomy between religion and science is an entirely unjustified one.  It is also relevant to note that in the last decade physicists have begun to comment on the striking similarities between their own discoveries and the discoveries made thousands of years ago in India which went on to form the basis of most Eastern religions.  Why has Sanskrit endured? Fundamentally it generates clarity and inspiration. And that clarity and inspiration is directly responsible for a brilliance of creative expression such as the world has rarely seen.   Another hope for the return of Sanskrit lies in computers. Sanskrit and computers are a perfect fit. The precision play of Sanskrit with computer tools will awaken the capacity in human beings to utilize their innate higher mental faculty with a momentum that would inevitably transform the world. In fact the mere learning of Sanskrit by large numbers of people in itself represents a quantum leap in consciousness, not to mention the rich endowment it will provide in the arena of future communication."

urlLink Osho Zen Tarot  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sharing    As you move above to the fourth center - that is the heart - your whole life becomes a sharing of love. The third center has created the abundance of love. By reaching to the third center in meditation, you have become so overflowing with love, with compassion, and you want to share. It happens at the fourth center, the heart.   That's why even in the ordinary world people think love comes out of the heart. For them it is just hearsay, they have heard it; they don't know it because they have never reached to their heart. But the meditator finally reaches to the heart. As he has reached to the center of his being - the third center - suddenly an explosion of love and compassion and joy and blissfulness and benediction has arisen in him with such a force that it hits his heart and opens the heart. The heart is just in the middle of all your seven centers - three centers below, three centers above. You have come exactly to the middle.  Commentary:  The Queen of Fire is so rich, so much a queen, that she can afford to give. It doesn't even occur to her to take inventories or to put something aside for later. She dispenses her treasures without limits, welcoming all and sundry to partake of the abundance, fertility and light that surrounds her.   When you draw this card, it suggests that you too are in a situation where you have an opportunity to share your love, your joy and your laughter. And in sharing, you find that you feel even more full.   There is no need to go anywhere or to make any special effort. You find that you can enjoy sensuality without possessiveness or attachment, can give birth to a child or to a new project with an equal sense of creativity fulfilled.   Everything around you seems to be "coming together" now. Enjoy it, ground yourself in it, and let the abundance in you and around you overflow.

urlLink Osho Zen Tarot  - Courage   The seed cannot know what is going to happen, the seed has never known the flower. And the seed cannot even believe that he has the potentiality to become a beautiful flower. Long is the journey, and it is always safer not to go on that journey because unknown is the path, nothing is guaranteed.   Nothing can be guaranteed. Thousand and one are the hazards of the journey, many are the pitfalls - and the seed is secure, hidden inside a hard core. But the seed tries, it makes an effort; it drops the hard shell which is its security, it starts moving. Immediately the fight starts: the struggle with the soil, with the stones, with the rocks. And the seed was very hard and the sprout will be very, very soft and dangers will be many.   There was no danger for the seed, the seed could have survived for millennia, but for the sprout many are the dangers. But the sprout starts towards the unknown, towards the sun, towards the source of light, not knowing where, not knowing why. Great is the cross to be carried, but a dream possesses the seed and the seed moves.   The same is the path for man. It is arduous. Much courage will be needed.  Commentary:  This card shows a small wildflower that has met the challenge of the rocks and stones in its path to emerge into the light of day. Surrounded by an aura of bright golden light, it exposes the majesty of its tiny self. Unashamed, it is equal to the brightest sun.   When we are faced with a very difficult situation we have a choice: we can either be resentful, and try to find somebody or something to blame for the hardships, or we can face the challenge and grow.   The flower shows us the way, as its passion for life leads it out of the darkness and into the light. There is no point fighting against the challenges of life, or trying to avoid or deny them. They are there, and if the seed is to become the flower we must go through them. Be courageous enough to grow into the flower you are meant to be.

urlLink A glimpse into the heart of a dying star - Behind the scenes at a stellar chemical factory :  An image taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows one of the most unusually long planetary nebulae found so far. Scientists think planetary nebulae hold the key to understanding how the Universe became enriched with heavier elements so they study them intensively. It is not well-understood how a perfectly round star can turn into such an unusual-looking nebula.  {Apply this concept to people.}   Planetary nebulae occur in a huge variety of shapes and sizes. They are the final stage of a star's life before it ends its days as a burnt-out white dwarf. When it dies, a star rapidly sheds the outer parts of its atmosphere, creating a planetary nebula that exists only as long as the star has fuel to burn.  {Apply this concept to people.}   Stars are large recycling factories. Over their lifetimes of millions of years they process huge amounts of the lighter elements (mostly hydrogen and helium)  {apply this concept to people}  into heavier ones (such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen)  {apply this concept to people} . These heavier elements are then dispersed into the surrounding space when the stars peel off their atmospheres to form planetary nebulae. In turn, the heavier elements may become part of other stars or end up in planetary systems like our own Solar System. This dispersion process is therefore one of the most important in the Universe and can tell us something about our own origins.  {Apply this concept to people.}

Damn, this article is about my friend Bill and his cars.    urlLink South Seattle Star : Heap of the Week    Bill Jacobs' '69 Dodge van isn't pretty, but in some ways that makes it all the better for the uses he puts it to. On a recent sunny afternoon, the van held a load of llama manure bound for the vegetable beds at his Beacon Hill home, and a slant-6 engine Jacobs will install in another of his vehicles, a '63 Dart. And there was a Toyota engine in there, too. (Jacobs is partial to old Dodges and Toyotas. He also owns a banged-up Toyota pickup he bought for 50 bucks. He replaced the timing chain and has since driven the truck clear across the country.)   The van is unusual in that it has double doors on both sides, which makes loading and unloading stuff like llama manure and slant-6 engines a heck of a lot easier. And then there are the unusual duties it has served in its 33 years. One previous owner made modifications to accommodate a wheelchair-using family member. And back when the van was new it was an animal control truck.  "I don't think they called it that back then," Jacobs said. "I think they called it the dog-catcher van. It was up in the San Juan Islands; I think that's why it has the rust."  In the three or four years he has owned it, Jacobs, an auto mechanic by training, has rebuilt the engine and the transmission. "It was so much work getting it out, I figured I would do it all," he said.  "I'm not going to tell you how much money I've put into it," he said, but he did allow that sending the radiator out to be re-cored set him back nearly as much as he paid for the van.  "I found the van on the Internet," Jacobs said. "This guy wanted $400 for it. The picture looked so good, but when I got there it looked like (bleep!)." So Jacobs bargained the price down.  "I paid $300 for the van and $250 to have the radiator rebuilt," he said. "They don't sell these anymore, so I had to have it rebuilt."    Jacobs, who will turn 34 this year, is thinking of getting out of the wrench-turning trade ("I don't know if I'll keep doing this kind of work," he said), but his skills make feasible owning and operating vehicles as old or older than he is. And while he acknowledges that the van isn't in great shape, he has no interest in parting with it.   "There's no way I could ever sell it and get back what I've put into it," he said.  That rebuilt engine certainly sounds healthy, but Jacobs admits the van doesn't run as well as it could.  "It would be nice to say that," he said. "It doesn't run perfect, but it gets the job done."

urlLink I-Ching.com :: Oracle of Changes : "Limits are necessary to give purpose and direction to life. Swimming in a sea of boundless opportunity would soon lead to exhaustion. Winging it alone in a sky of boundless opportunity would lead to being lost. In human affairs, the making of choices, and alliances, implies limitation, for in choosing one path another must be abandoned.  One key to a successful life is to select your limits consciously and carefully - to be discriminating in the setting of personal boundaries and knowing when to join in formation. Thrift, for example, often precedes prosperity; just as the letting go of selfish interests often leads to greater personal reward. Only by consciously accepting useful limits can one's energy be channeled to good purpose, and lead to lasting accomplishment.  Point yourself toward a middle way, the mean between discipline and freedom of spirit. Limits will come of their own accord; but to be able to consciously select your own affiliations in life - that's knowing how to fly! At the same time, do not go overboard on discipline. Even limitation must be limited, so that in attempting to bring order and direction into your life you do not choke off vital sources of enthusiasm and spontaneity.  Similarly, in groups and organizations, the rules and regulations should strike a balance between being too strict and too soft. If too strict, they build frustration among people, and ultimately become destructive. If too lenient, sloppiness becomes acceptable, and energy is soon dissipated. The best path is one which allows for the fulfillment of individual potential, while encouraging self-discipline and focus."
urlLink Be My Tongue : "Cymothoa exigua, a crustacean, makes its home inside the mouth of a fish.

Here's what the doctor says I have -  ACUTE BRONCHITIS  Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, or bronchi (the air passages that extend from the windpipe into the lungs). The inflammation may be caused by a virus, bacteria, smoking or the inhalation of chemical pollutants or dust. When the cells of the bronchial-lining tissue are irritated beyond a certain point, the tiny hairs (cilia) within them, which normally trap and eliminate pollutants, stop functioning. Consequently, the air passages become clogged by debris and irritation increases. In response, a heavy secretion of mucus develops, which causes the characteristic cough of bronchitis. Acute bronchitis usually lasts about 10 days. Severe cases may also cause general malaise and chest pain.

Osho on True Love  - Love is not something permanent, eternal. Remember, what poets say is not true. Don\B4t take their criterion, that the true love is eternal, and untrue love is momentary - no! Just the opposite is the case. The true love is very momentary - but what a moment!... such that one can lose the whole of eternity for it, can risk the whole of eternity for it. Who wants that moment to be permanent? And why should permanency be valued so much?... because life is change, flow; only death is permanent.
Cancer Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com)  Little voices are whispering in your ear today, and it could be that they are asking you to lift off the ground and join them in the clouds, dear Cancer.

The city, immortalizing Alexander's name, quickly flourished into a prominent cutural,  intellectual , political, and economic metropolis, the remains of which are still evident to this day.  It was the renowned capital of the  Ptolemies , with numerous monuments. It was the site of the  Lighthouse , one of the  Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , as well as the  Great Library .

The contemplation for this week is:  "An artist uses color to paint different forms on canvas: cows and tigers, rivers and mountains, houses and trees. Similarly, God has created this infinitely varied universe with His sublime skill. He exists as the Consciousness that pervades everything, that invents infinite colors and generates marvelous forms - all for the sake of love and beauty and joy. Everything that exists is for giving satisfaction to the inner Self." -- Swami Muktananda

The people there are all so nice and seem so happy and at peace. They showed Gurumayi's videotaped lectures and she had really beautiful messages and stories to share.  I am still admittedly confused by the guru idea, maybe because there seem to be so many out there. This is my first experience with a guru. I feel connected to the energy.

urlLink Guru's Gallery :  "Once we know the particular shop from which we can purchase all our requirements, why should we wander among all the shops in the market?  It is a waste of time and is of no use.  In the same way, if we have found a Guru, we should stop wandering and do sadhana, striving to reach the goal.   The Guru himself will come to the seeker.  There is no need to wander in search of him, but the seeker should have intense dispassion towards the world.   A Guru is indespensible for a sadhak (aspirant).  If a child goes near the edge of a pond, the mother points out the danger and leads the child away.  In like manner, the Guru gives appropriate instructions when necessary.  His attention is always on the disciple.   Even though God is all-pervading, a Guru's presence is unique.  Even though the wind blows everywhere, we enjoy coolness only under the shade of a tree.  Doesn't the breeze that blows through the leaves of a tree have a soothing effect on those who travel in the hot sun?  Similarly, a Guru is necessary for us who live in the scorching heat of worldly existence.  The Guru's presence will give us peace and tranquillity.   A real Guru desires only the spiritual growth of the disciple.  Tests and trials are given for the disciple's improvement and to remove his weaknesses.  A Guru may even blame a disciple for errors he has not committed.  Only those who steadily withstand such trials can grow.   Even though one may come in contact with a Guru, he will be accepted as a disciple only if he is fit.  Without Guru's grace, one cannot know the Guru.  One who is really in search of the Truth will have humility and simplicity.  The Guru's grace will be showered only on such a person.  A person full of ego cannot have access to the Guru."  -- Mata Amritanandamayi, For My Children, San Ramon, CA: Mata Amritanandamayi Center, 1994

urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : 23. The Creator  There are two types of creators in the world. One type of creator works with objects - a poet, a painter, they work with objects, they create things. The other type of creator, the mystic, creates himself. He doesn't work with objects, he works with the subject; he works on himself, his own being. And he is the real creator, the real poet, because he makes himself into a masterpiece.   You are carrying a masterpiece hidden within you, but you are standing in the way. Just move aside, then the masterpiece will be revealed. Everyone is a masterpiece, because God never gives birth to anything less than that. Everyone carries that masterpiece hidden for many lives, no knowing who they are and just trying on the surface to become someone.   Drop the idea of becoming someone, because you are already a masterpiece. You cannot be improved. You have only to come to it, to know it, to realize it. God himself has created you; you cannot be improved.  Osho Ah, This! Chapter 1

urlLink Free I-Ching Reading : "Increase and decrease are part of the natural cycle of life. As another good book puts it, 'To every thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.' Like a reservoir that is being used to irrigate the fields, learning to accept a decrease in position or material possessions is part of preparing for increase in the future.  We may live in materialistic times, but there is no disgrace in material decrease, particularly if it represents an investment in future gain - even if that gain be in the form of learning or the development of personal character. Likewise, the inner strength that comes from bearing loss can be balanced by a corresponding increase in inner strength and insight. When letting go of material desires leads to a greater simplicity in daily life, good fortune often comes calling.  In nature, the lake evaporates to form the clouds that drop the rain which nurtures the surrounding forest. As the forest grows thick, more rain is captured for the lake. Similarly, an 'evaporation' or decrease in one area of your life, may give rise to an eventual increase. A loss of responsibility at work can mean more free time; more free time may generate more career options. A decrease in material possessions can free the spirit and fill the soul.  Be mindful of the lesson of young lovers: even with a minimum of possessions, feelings of the heart can bring an unsurpassed richness to life. The smallest of actions, if sincere, have value. So remain confident, for a time of decrease may actually bode good fortune. Especially if you remain open to that possibility.  Let go of frustration, resistance and regret over whatever may be decreasing at this time. Accept the cycle."

Realization: The Poori Effect: How We Sometimes Fool Ourselves  Just seated in an Indian vegetarian buffet restaurant with a friend, a beaming waitress comes along, "Poori or nan (traditional flour-based foods)?" I replied "Two nans please." She remarked enthusiastically, "Oh, would you like to try the poori?" "No." She smiled on, "They are very nice. Have you tried them before? You should try!" I smiled weakly, "Okay one poori and one nan." I tried poori before, but prefer nan. But she was so unknowingly pushy that I patronised her. She walked by later, saw the empty plate, and asked, once again, beaming happily, "Was the poori nice?" My friend smiled sheepishly and gave a weak nod. She too prefers nan. The waitress smiles back, moving off to serve another "happy" customer.   I call this "The Poori Effect." It is the unmindful shaping of the world according to one's perceptions. The waitress already made up her mind as to what we should try before asking- her favourite. Due to the way she carried herself, we "naturally obliged". We were later "obliged" to give her a positive response- out of "courtesy". The result was a totally deluded idea of our opinion of poori. We might have made her day in the worldly sense, but at the expense of reinforcing her delusion. We sometimes "unwittingly" mirror the world - the world smiles and we smile back. But is your smile true? On the other hand, is your smiling "forcing" the world to smile back reluctantly or genuinely? We see what we want to see. I know friends who seemingly get along well with others, who ironically talk behind their backs. The Poori Effect is a case of two-way hypocrisy- bad faith. We are at times not mindfully sincere enough to discover how the world truly feels about us and present ourselves in a way that will not receive negative feedback. This is hypocrisy to oneself and others, even though there might be some genuine goodwill within. When we patronise in return, giving positive feedback which is ungenuine, it is hypocrisy too. Either way, anyone being hypocritical is being untrue. Can we learn to speak true and wise words, about what we feel, in a kind way? Even if the truth bites a little, does it matter? Since it is "sugar-coated" with kindness, the truth should be more digestible, right?    Asking is hypocritical, to oneself and others, if you do so with an answer in mind. Some even cling on to the answer in their mind when they receive an answer they do not like. "No no, what does he know? Pooris are the best!" Do you stop to reflect that the world does not have the same perception as you? But what is the truth about preferences and opinions? Preferences are about personal likes and dislikes (feelings that arise from attachment and aversion) that arise with our clouded perception- and the Buddha says that feelings and perceptions are illusory. Because we do not see things as they truly are (have wrong perception), we develop feelings of wanting to hold or reject. Everything changes fleetingly in the moment, some noticeable, some less. Pooris might taste much better if I let go of my aversion? Nans might be just as good to the waitress if she lets go of hers?   Let us cultivate a mind with greater equanamity - a calm and balanced mental state uncluttered by likes and dislikes. The more equanimous the mind is, the more sincere one is to oneself and others. When we ask a question for opinion with an equanimous state of mind, we are able to more accurately receive and analyse the answers others give objectively. This is crucial to both worldly and spiritual discernment. Only so can we realise the truth in its entire spectrum, from pooris to nans, to understanding ourselves and the world at large - leading to Enlightenment! -  urlLink shian@TheDailyEnlightenment.com

urlLink Rakhi Day Meaning from the India Heritage Research Foundation  "The holiday of Rakhsha Bandhan, or Rakhi, is a celebration of the bond of love and the bond of family. On this day, sisters tie sacred threads around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and affection. In return, the brother promises to protect his sister and to always be there for her. Rakhsha means protection or security and bandhan means a bond or relation. Thus, Rakhsha Bandhan symbolizes the bond of security and protection between brothers and sisters. However, on Rakhi, the brothers and sisters do not have to be blood relatives. That is the beauty of Indian culture. Our tradition tells us that the world is our brother and sister. As the dawn breaks on the new millennium, we must realize that the only way the world will survive is united as one family. Thus, now, we must also take the deeper, underlying meaning of Rakhi. We must vow to make the world our brothers and sisters not only in theory, but also in practice. Let us use rakhi as a symbol of our universal brotherhood. May our girls and women lead the way toward this universal family as they tie rakhi bracelets on the wrists of not only their closest male friends, but also on the wrists of enemies. Let us use this holiday to reach out to those around us, embracing them as brother and sister."

urlLink Osho Zen Tarot Card: Laziness  "When you are lazy, it is a negative taste: you simply feel that you have no energy, you simply feel dull; you simply feel sleepy, you simply feel dead. When you are in a state of non-doing then you are full of energy--it is a very positive taste. You have full energy, overflowing. You are radiant, bubbling, vibrating, You are not sleepy, you are perfectly aware. You are not dead--you are tremendously alive....There is a possibility the mind can deceive you: it can rationalize laziness as non-doing. It can say, 'I have become a Zen master,' or, 'I believe in Tao'--but you are not deceiving anybody else. You will be deceiving only yourself. So be alert.  Osho A Sudden Clash of Thunder Chapter 8  Commentary: This gentleman clearly thinks he's got it made. He sits in his big over-stuffed chair, wearing his sunglasses, shaded by his umbrella, with his pink slippers and his pi\F1a colada in his hand. He doesn't have the energy to get up and do anything because he thinks he's done it already. He hasn't yet turned to see the mirror cracking around him on his right, a sure sign that the place he thinks he's finally arrived at is about to shatter and dissolve before his very eyes. The message this card brings is that this poolside resort is not your final destination. The journey isn't over yet, as that white bird flying into the vastness of the sky is trying to show. Your complacency might have arisen from a real sense of achievement, but now it's time to move on. No matter how fuzzy the slippers, how tasty the pi\F1a colada, there are skies upon skies still waiting to be explored."

urlLink Grof Transpersonal Training - What is holotropic breathwork? :  "Holotropic Breathwork is a powerful approach to self-exploration and healing that integrates insights from modern consciousness research, anthropology, various depth psychologies, transpersonal psychology, Eastern spiritual practices, and mystical traditions of the world. The name Holotropic means literally 'moving toward wholeness' (from the Greek 'holos'=whole and 'trepein'=moving in the direction of something).  The process itself uses very simple means: it combines accelerated breathing with evocative music in a special set and setting. With the eyes closed and lying on a mat, each person uses their own breath and the music in the room to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness. This state activates the natural inner healing process of the individual's psyche, bringing him or her a particular set of internal experiences. With the inner healing intelligence guiding the process, the quality and content brought forth is unique to each person and for that particular time and place. While recurring themes are common, no two sessions are ever alike.  Additional elements of the process include focused energy release work and mandala drawing. Holotropic Breathwork is usually done in groups, although individual sessions are also possible. Within the groups, people work in pairs and alternate in the roles of experiencer and 'sitter'. The sitter's role is simply to be available to assist the breather, not to interfere or interrupt the process. The same is true for trained facilitators, who are available as helpers if necessary."

Today's Cancer Horoscope   by Astrocenter.com : Today, dear Cancer, is a day to separate the wheat from the chaff. Or, in other words, to take a good long look at your relationships and decide who is a true friend and who is not. You are very loyal, which is certainly to your credit. But what is the point of being loyal to people who do not return the courtesy? You have given your so-called friends more than enough opportunities to demonstrate their affection.

urlLink The Transformation Tarot : "A king went into his garden and found wilted and dying trees, shrubs and flowers. The oak said it was dying because it could not be tall like the pine. Turning to the pine, he found it drooping because it was unable to bear grapes like the vine. And the vine was dying because it could not blossom like the rose. He found Heart's-ease blooming and as fresh as ever. Upon inquiry, he received this reply:   'I took it for granted that when you planted me you wanted Heart's-ease. If you had desired an oak, a vine or a rose, you would have planted them. So I thought that since you put me here, I should do the best I can to be what you want. I can be nothing but what I am, and I am trying to be that to the best of my ability.'   You are here because this existence needs you as you are. Otherwise somebody else would have been here!--existence would not have helped you to be here, would not have created you. You are fulfilling something very essential, something very fundamental, as you are. If God wanted a Buddha he could have produced as many Buddhas as he wanted. He produced only one Buddha--that was enough, and he was satisfied to his heart's desire, utterly satisfied. Since then he has not produced another Buddha or another Christ.   He has created you instead. Just think of the respect that the universe has given to you! You have been chosen, not Buddha, not Christ, not Krishna. You will be needed more, that's why. You fit more now. Their work is done, they contributed their fragrance to existence. Now you have to contribute your fragrance.   But the moralists, the puritans, the priests, they go on teaching you, they go on driving you crazy. They say to the rose, 'Become a lotus.' And they say to the lotus, 'What are you doing here? You have to become something else." They drive the whole garden crazy, everything starts dying--because nobody can be anybody else, that is not possible.   That's what has happened to humanity. Everybody is pretending. Authenticity is lost, truth is lost, everybody is trying to show that he is somebody else. Just look at yourself: you are pretending to be somebody else. And you can be only yourself--there is no other way, there has never been, there is no possibility that you can be anybody else. You will remain yourself. You can enjoy it and bloom, or you can wither away if you condemn it."

urlLink Weekly Review - Sep 9, 2003: Harper's Magazine   President George W. Bush made a televised address to the nation and declared that Iraq was now the "central front" in the war on terrorism. He called for national resolve and national sacrifice and said that he will ask Congress for $87 billion in emergency funds for the occupation. It was noted that this new request, which comes on top of $79 billion already approved, will probably push the current budget deficit up to $600 billion. Howard Dean said the speech, which made no mention of Osama bin Laden, was "outrageous" and said it reminded him of Lyndon Johnson and the Vietnam War. Senator Bob Graham observed that Bush now wants to spend more on Iraq this year than the federal government will spend on education. Gunmen fired on a Sunni mosque in Baghdad just after morning prayers and injured three people, a car bomb exploded near the headquarters of the Baghdad police department, a British bomb squad expert was killed, an American Humvee was blown up, and Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez said that attacks on American forces were down to about 14 or 15 a day. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was touring Iraq and Afghanistan, complained that the news media was ignoring "the story of success and accomplishment" in Iraq. Rumsfeld acknowledged that he still doesn't know who is carrying out the guerrilla attacks but said that the intelligence community is working on it. "They're not comfortable at the moment with what we don't know." A man died and several others were injured while riding Disneyland's Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. The World Council of Churches denounced the invasion of Iraq as "immoral" and "ill advised" and called for the withdrawal of American forces. A congressional study found that the occupation of Iraq is unsustainable given the current size of the U.S. military, and the United States released a draft resolution calling on the United Nations to create a multinational peacekeeping force for Iraq that would remain under American military and political control. Heavy fighting continued in Afghanistan, and surface-to-air missiles were fired at a transport plane in Baghdad. Donald Rumsfeld, who was nearby, said that such attacks are just a cost of doing business. Rumsfeld claimed that there has been "breathtaking" progress in Afghanistan since the war ended. "I'm not being Pollyannaish," he said. "I'm telling the truth."   President Bush, apparently worried about the fact that the American economy has lost almost 3 million jobs since he took office, promised to appoint a "manufacturing czar" who will watch out for blue-collar jobs. The Labor Department announced that 93,000 jobs were lost in August, and a new study found that the federal workforce is at its highest level (12.1 million) since the Cold War. The Census Department reported that the number of poor people increased last year by 1.3 million. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a settlement with energy companies that benefited from market manipulation in the California energy crisis two years ago. The companies agreed to pay about $1 million in fines, or about 3 cents for every Californian, though the energy scam cost the state $8.9 billion, or $250 per citizen. The Environmental Protection Agency relaxed restrictions on selling land contaminated with PCBs, and an astronomer argued that Venus once had a climate similar to Earth's, prior to its transformation by the greenhouse effect. A federal appeals court blocked the FCC's new rules expanding the freedom of media monopolies, and Jessica Lynch, the former Army private who was captured by Iraqis and became the subject of an elaborate heroic fiction, signed a book deal and reportedly received a $1 million advance. Lynch will share the advance with her co-author Rick Bragg, a former New York Times reporter. Seattle was considering a tax on espresso.   North Koreans danced in the streets holding bunches of flowers to celebrate the reelection of Kim Jong Il as chairman of the National Defense Commission, his primary office; Kim Il Sung, who has been dead for almost ten years, is still officially the head of state. The Bush Administration retreated from its position that North Korea must simply submit to American demands; one State Department source said that the policy shift was accomplished while many of the Pentagon officials who have driven the administration's hard-line stance were on vacation. There were rumors of a coup plot in the Philippines. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt condemned gay marriage. An Israeli commission of inquiry concluded that police used excessive force in putting down a riot by Israeli Arabs three years ago in which 13 people were killed. The commission suggested that the police stop using snipers armed with rubber-coated steel bullets to disperse Arab crowds. Three Israeli F-15 fighter jets piloted by the descendants of Holocaust survivors flew over the Auschwitz death camp in Poland during a memorial service. The Auschwitz Museum had opposed the flyover, saying that a military display was inappropriate on such an occasion. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian prime minister, resigned, and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, was injured in an Israeli airstrike. A car bomb blew up in a market outside Srinagar, Kashmir, killing at least six people and wounding dozens. A train was blown up in Chechnya.

Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy said that judges are lunatics and are anthropologically different from other people. Paul J. Hill, a Christian who murdered an abortion doctor in Pensacola, Florida, was executed by lethal injection. Hill said that he was looking forward to getting his reward in heaven. Christians holding signs wept outside the prison; one sign read "Dead Doctors Can't Kill." Interrogators at Camp Delta, the American penal colony in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were said to be using Twinkies and McDonald's Happy Meals to make the prisoners talk. Britney Spears, a pop star, declared her faith in President Bush: "Honestly," she said, "I think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes and we should just support that."

The contemplation for this week is:  What is the key to self-trust? Self-acknowledgement, self-acknowledgment, self-acknowledgment. How would it affect your state if, each time you came through on a promise or duty or performed some beneficial action, you took the time to acknowledge yourself? What if you take a moment and thank yourself?   Become sensitive to the good things that you do, especially something out of the blue. Make it a constant practice to acknowledge yourself every time you come through.  -- Gurumayi Chidvilasananda

urlLink Tarot.com ::  : "An uncommon individual has exceptional knowledge and deep understanding of your relationship with your possible love interest. The card in the Love & Me position touches on an aspect of how you perceive yourself with regard to possible intimacy in your life. The Hierophant is someone who knows him or herself to be exceptional. Every circle includes the few who know and understand and the many who aspire to do so. This card acknowledges you as a person with inner knowledge above and beyond theory and scholarship, who is able to contact the spirit world on behalf of humanity. In ancient times shamans were the healers, astrologers and early fabricators of metals and medicines for tribal societies.   Nowadays the Hierophant represents those who have special knowledge in their field. She or he speaks wisely from true and direct experience, and serves in a leadership role in your potential relationship. Use this knowledge wisely on behalf of yourself and your possible love interest. It may very likely serve your long-term goals. "
urlLink Tarot Reading :  "The situation is unpredictable. Empty the vessel, releasing any preconceived agenda. Allow yourself and your potential love interest to be guided from a still, calm place within. The card that lands in the Situation position refers to social or circumstantial factors which could be affecting your life at this time. When the Fool is in this position, your upcoming romantic situation may be undefined and open-ended. You do not know, nor can you even begin to guess, what is happening in another person's head. This can create either a feeling of panic or relief. On the other hand, having no blueprint frees you up from the pressure of expectations. You are also free to do something really foolish because there are no rules set out for you!   This is a test of your own internal guidance system. Can you refrain from getting desperate about your potential relationship in the absence of structure?"

urlLink I-Ching Reading :  "Personal resolution points to a breakthrough, but decisive action is necessary. As long as you diligently hold your ground and ward off negative tendencies or evil influences, the good will prevail.  The persistence of evil is a constant in human affairs; just when it is thought to have been eradicated, up it will pop again, sprouting through some crack in the pavement of decent society. Evil need not take extravagant, forms, such as those exhibited in Nazi Germany. Garden-variety lies and deceit are much more common and persistent, but should be rooted out just as diligently. One must be resolved against negativity - whether in one's social or professional life, or in one's own soul. In either case, definite rules must be followed for the struggle to succeed.  The first rule: do not compromise with evil. Negative actions must be identified openly for what they are, and discredited. The second: one cannot resist negativity on its own terms. New, positive alternatives which lead away from the source of the problem are generally more successful, and appropriate, than to counter negativity with raw power. The third rule: the means used to counter negativity must be consistent with the end to be achieved. One cannot stop the spreading of lies by spreading more of them.  Spring is approaching. Good times ahead seems inevitable; there is vitality in the air. This is a most auspicious time. Like a snake emerging from hibernation, negative forces are only just beginning to stir, and can be effectively controlled. This is a time of hopeful progress, and must be used to best advantage. When approaching good fortune, conscientious work pays great dividends. A clear road lies ahead.  Act now, for at some point this ripe opportunity for advancement will be reversed. No spring lasts forever. It's always wise to stay alert and note the changing signs of the times.  Spring is always the season of new relationships. In the bounty of good times, new bonds are formed effortlessly. Relationships born in spring can serve well to warm the following autumn and winter."

------------------------ Yahoo! Groups ---------------------~--> Bodhi Mail  - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bodhimail -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Message: 1    Date: Tue, 07 Oct 2003 14:48:42 -0500    From: "SD"   Subject: we donot pray to Buddha to save us  Develop wisdom to overcome Avijjaa  By P. S. Mahawatte   Almost all religions in the world except Buddhism have as their foundation a creator God and an immortal soul. Let us briefly examine the core beliefs of a few of these religions.  The core belief in Hinduism is, after death one joins Paramathma. They are required to have utmost Faith in the Trio- Brahma - (Creator); Vishnu - (Ruler) and Shiva- (Destroyer) of the Universe. To them, Moksya could be achieved only after death. There are other gods such as Ganapathy and Skanda and by having faith in them, they can pray to enable them to find security and lead prosperous lives.  Buddhists, too, visit these Kovils and pray to these Gods seeking mundane help to overcome their various day to day problems. But unlike Hindus, the Buddhists perform meritorious acts and transfer the merit thus acquired, to Gods and seek their help. According to Buddhism Gods are unable to commit meritorious acts by themselves. The Buddha said that people pray out of fear and that fear is due to inability to understand things as they really are. This is due to Avijja - nescience or ignorance and the Buddha has taught his disciples how to develop the Wisdom needed to bring to an end this Avijja.  Almighty God  Christianity which came to be long after Hinduism also believes in an Almighty God as the creator of the universe. They are expected to have complete faith in the Trinity - Father, Son and the Holy Ghost. This appears to have some similarity to the Hindu trio Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Their Mokshya which they believe as joining their soul with the Creator, can be achieved only after death and that too, only with God\92s love and repenting for their sins and prayer. They cannot achieve Mokshya by their own efforts.  Islam also requires absolute faith in Almighty Allah and is also based on Atma - Soul and to have utmost faith in the Creator God and to pray daily, so that after death they join their Creator - Mokshya.  The followers of the above religions hold fast to the belief that there is an immortal soul somewhere within them, which they want to continue to exist forever, by joining with their Creator.  Let us now listen to what the Buddha had to say on this subject. A Bhikku once asked the Buddha \91Ven. Sir, is there a case where one is tormented when something permanent within oneself is not found\92.  The Buddha said \91Yes, Bhikku there is. A man has the following view. The Universe is that Atman, I shall be that after death, permanent, abiding, everlasting, unchanging and I shall exist as such for eternity.  \91He hears the Thathagatha or a disciple of his, preaching the doctrine aiming at the complete destruction of all speculative views ... aiming at the extinction of \91Thirst\92 Thanha, aiming at detachment, cessation Nirvana\92. Then that man thinks \91I will be annihilated, I will be destroyed, I will be no more. So he mourns, worries himself, laments, weeps, beating his breasts and become bewildered. Thus O Bhikku, there is a case where one is tormented when something permanent within oneself is not found\92 (from What the Buddha taught by late Dr. Walpola Rahula thera).

urlLink Metagifted Education Resource Organization: Introduction to Indigo Children :  What's an Indigo Child?  by Wendy H. Chapman  Indigo Children are the current generation being born today and most of those who are 8 years old or younger. They are different. They have very unique characteristics that set them apart from previous generations of children. The name itself indicates the Life Color they carry in their auras and is indicative of the Third Eye Chakra, which represents intuition and psychic ability. These are the children who are often rebellious to authority, nonconformist, extremely emotionally and sometimes physically sensitive or fragile, highly talented or academically gifted and often metaphysically gifted as well, usually intuitive, very often labeled ADD, either very empathic and compassionate OR very cold and callous, and are wise beyond their years. Does this sound like yourself or your child?   Indigos have come into this world with difficult challenges to overcome. Their extreme levels of sensitivity are hard to understand and appreciate by parents who don't share this trait. Their giftedness is unusual in such high numbers. Their nonconformity to systems and to discipline will make it difficult to get through their childhood years and perhaps even their adult years. It is also what will help them accomplish big goals such as changing the educational system, for instance. Being an Indigo won't be easy for any of them, but it foretells a mission. The Indigo Children are the ones who have come to raise the vibration of our planet! These are the primary ones who will bring us the enlightenment to ascend.   There's a very good chance your child is an Indigo if he/she was born after 1992. About 85% or higher of children born in '92 or later, 90% born in '94 or after and 95% or more born now (some even say 99%) are Indigo Children! Does this mean you aren't one if you were born prior to 1992? No! I've heard reports that they started coming in the 80s, but that means coming in larger numbers. I believe there have been Indigos born in every year, but perhaps not in high enough percentages to notice their presence and see what makes them so unique. So can you be a 24 yr old Indigo or a 50 year old one? Yes!    urlLink NEXT - Is Your Child an Indigo?

Rather than night opposing day, dark suppressing light, they work together to create a unified whole, turning endlessly one into the other, each containing in its deepest core the seed of the opposite.   The eagle and the swan are both beings of flight and majesty. The eagle is the embodiment of power and aloneness. The swan is the embodiment of space and purity, gently floating and diving, upon and within the element of the emotions, entirely content and complete within her perfection and beauty.   We are the union of eagle and swan: male and female, fire and water, life and death. The card of integration is the symbol of self-creation, new life, and mystical union; otherwise known as alchemy."
urlLink Maya del Mar's Free Daily Success Guide Astrological Forecast : "SUNDAY NOVEMBER 23. The New Moon Solar Eclipse at 2 Sagittarius occurs at 4:02 p.m. The Sagittarius moon cycle is about moving into the world, spreading the word, letting the world know the truth of the matter and what we are about. In Scorpio we went through the dark tunnel of initiation. Now in Sagittarius we emerge into the bright sunlight, spread our wings, and fly. We feel reborn, and the world is our oyster. We want to announce it to one and all.  Sun and Moon's last contacts were their squares with Uranus, and they come into this fresh world with a great deal of independence. This eclipse will renew our autonomy, both personally and in the world. Uranus can also indicate surprises, and in Washington DC it is exactly overhead.  Mars is still jazzed up from its opposition to adventurous Jupiter, and it's now building up to a very assertive square with Pluto on Wednesday. At the same time, during the 48 hours from last night through tomorrow night, both Mercury and Moon square Mars and conjoin Pluto to fill our hearts and minds with aggressive vibes.  This is a dangerous time. A solar eclipse hides consciousness and allows the unconscious to rule. Sagittarius is the sign of the gambler. And aggressive Mars/Pluto impulses are raining into our head and heart, represented by Mercury and Moon.  Moon not only transits over Mercury tomorrow night; but it also eclipses Mercury, thus blotting out logic, and giving Mercury extra significance. Mercury adds to the already-strong movement and travel urges of this time.  Sagittarius is expansive. It is a no-holds-barred sign, always ready to go. It is very helpful now to have a plan of action, as a channel for the energy which is being released.

urlLink FTAA lite seen as deal-breaker  By STEVEN CHASE Miami \97 Canada and other countries warned yesterday that a bid by the United States and Brazil to significantly narrow the scope of a proposed free-trade area of the Americas agreement could derail the talks under way in Miami. A group opposed to the barebones deal \97 including Canada, Chile, and Mexico \97 says the 'FTAA lite' salvage proposal Washington and Brasilia have cobbled together to salvage talks is insufficient to keep negotiations moving forward.  'This is simply a papering over of differences and is not enough to establish a basis for continuing [talks],' a source close to FTAA negotiations in Miami said yesterday. The move by Washington and Brasilia to a lowest-common-denominator FTAA deal, ridiculed as 'FTAA lite', reflects gaping disagreements between the two economic titans of the Western Hemisphere over how far negotiations should go in dismantling trade barriers.

The Wisdom & Compassion of a Bodhisattva  Moonpointer Newsletter #1 Realisation:  Looking for the Moon   "Told her to look at the moon last night...  and she almost missed the big low rising yellow crescent moon,  as she was looking for a small high hanging white full moon.   What is the moon like really?  Neither of the above - not always full or not -  it is constant change itself -  waxing or waning all the time- Anicca!  The universal truth of impermanence.  When we look for specific things in life, we might miss the real thing, or even better things. What other things in life do we look for in a specific form? When nothing stays the same...  Let us open our hearts and minds, and be one with change, both physical and mental, both within and without us, both in dealing with things, matters and people. We can't help it that we ourselves change too. But we can help ourselves if we are mindful about our changes, and change only for the better."

urlLink PRESS RELEASE ( PR Web) Millions Celebrate Most Spectacular Planetary Alignment in 6,000 Years - November 8/9, 2003 "The Harmonic Concordance" : "The total lunar eclipse is part of what is known in astrology as a Grand Sextile pattern \96 a wonderful, harmonious flow of energy between six planets in our solar system. Within this pattern is yet another powerful pattern known as The Star of David, an important mystic symbol.  This is the most significant alignment in the 6,000 year span between 3,000 BC and 3,000 CE. This is one powerful moment in time -- but its effects can last for centuries to come.   The general consensus is that (at the very least) this moment is likely to bestow grace and blessings upon those who spend this time and use the high energies it produces with their hearts and minds focused spiritually.  There have been numerous speculations about what might happen during this time. Some are rather extreme, to say the least. Some expect to see the first wave of Ascension take place. Others are waiting for spaceships to take us away. Still others wonder if the astrological chart is foretelling a type of universal rapture.   Blaze believes it is not so much about the outward events, but an opportunity for to make this time as spiritually powerful as possible. In other words, be \93spiritually proactive\94; don\92t wait for things to happen.  Powerful planetary events can and often do coincide with events in the world around us, and these can indeed be regarded as \93signposts\94 from the Cosmos. Astrology is a language of the Divine, and It uses such events to \93talk\94 to us.   However, first we have to raise our vibrations through spiritual work and meditation, in order to attune ourselves to what is being said. Once we learn to do this, then indeed we can expect sublime events,"
urlLink Llewellyn Journal - The Harmonic Concordance, a Time of Enlightenment and Letting Go : "Right now the world stands ready to receive a great spiritual gift from the universe. After the conflict and trouble of the last several years, staring with the Grand Cross in August 1999 and continuing with the Saturn/Pluto opposition of 2001, we are now being given a great reward. The November 8, 2003 Lunar Eclipse at 16 degrees of Taurus brings with it several positive, once in a lifetime aspects, brimming over with positive energy.  First, the eclipse itself is one of the best of the Saros series of eclipses. An eclipse series has a history behind it, bringing forth either positive or negative energy. This one is positive. All the best of Taurus energy is flowing in and around this eclipse. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the planet of love and harmony. Taurus is concerned with the issues of relationships, money, real estate, beauty and the greenery of the earth. Taurus is the gardener of the zodiac, the one who plants her garden and then waits and watches it grow. Now is a great time to plant some seeds and wait for them to shoot up."
urlLink The Harmonic Concordance: The Chart Heard 'round the World  "The total lunar eclipse of November 8, 2003 reveals a moment in time potentially more potent than the "cosmic stampede" in Taurus in May of 2000 or of any of a host of other "important" dates projected for 2003.  The planetary energies present are very appropriate to a moment that would carry the astrological signature of the Ascension.    Consider the qualities of the planets as they are represented through the metaphors of astrology:       The Sun - the primal energy; the cause for being; masculine in nature; the basic will and vitality that inspires life; our creativity and conscious aim;that which expresses the best of who we are,      The Moon - the archetypical feminine; the mother; the personal subconscious mind, memory and imagination the; tidal ebb and flow of emotion; the avenues of habit and instinct; the shelter of home,      Jupiter - the king of the gods; beneficence, good fortune and expansion; the publication of ideals; the higher mind, wisdom and enthusiasm; generosity, optimism and increase on all levels,      Mars - the courage, desire, energy and willingness to act;  the stimulation of passion; the ability to be the spiritual warrior,      Saturn - the physical bones of the Earth and our bodies; the disciplinarian and 'tester' of our metal;  the limitations of the physical; endurance,  perseverance,  and stability, and finally,      Chiron   - the crystal rainbow bridge between physicality and spirit, the inner and outer planets; the wounded healer; Christ consciousness; initiation; the interface between God and Godling."

Jubilados is a non-profit corporation dedicated to promoting that joyful way of being in the elder years.  Jubilados is a non-profit corporation dedicated to contemplative practice, service and ecology. Our educational program includes symposia, focus groups and study groups. As an extension of these educational efforts, a community based on the principles developed in the symposia is being planned. The community will be open to anyone with a contemplative spiritual practice. The community's physical structure will be organized according to the principles of Permaculture. Permaculture allows that in natural systems, there is no waste; all resources can create benefit.   At Jubilados, old age is seen not as an end point, but rather as a rededication to creative service as an expression of the spiritual connection. The community is in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The site provides a setting conducive to spiritual practice, and is close to medical, educational and recreational services. More important, the proximity affords the opportunity for meaningful service in many community settings. The Jubilados Community will create an integrated lifestyle, based on mutual support rather than dependence.  The physical plant will be constructed in traditional village design with clustered buildings, allowing for the greater part of the site to be dedicated to open space. Common areas will include a meditation hall, communal kitchen, dining facilities and administrative offices. There will also be a library, a theatre, a gym and studios. Residences will consist of eight bedroom / bathroom suites clustered around a common kitchen / living area. Jubilados will begin construction in a year and will be ready to receive occupants in 2002.

Your Week in Focus by John - December 08 to 14  There is no doubt that you are more serious about your objectives than you have been for some time, HEATHER. Yet, on the other hand, you are also a lot more fearful of failing. It seems that you have the choice to have more faith in yourself and to stretch yourself to try new things, or you can instead choose to ignore the opportunities banging on your door, and carry on in the same old way. Yet the influences around you at this time will encourage you to explore new options. Venus and Mercury in your opposite sign of Capricorn may mean that friends, loved ones, and anyone you are with on a regular basis will all try to encourage you to do things that they know will make you feel a whole lot better. You need a touch of ecstasy after all that you have been through. And your friends want to see you sing and dance, love and be filled with joy. Much of what you will be combating at this time will be the devils within, rather than the circumstances without. The Sun conjuncts Pluto in Sagittarius, which means that a change of rules or a new project may bring a delightful new element into your working week.

urlLink My Tarot Reading For Today : Your situation is changing. Your future seems uncertain. Take heart and wait it out -- peace will return in its own time. In the meanwhile, do not waste your precious life force worrying about something you cannot control. The Situation position refers to the general set of influences that surround you and affect your personal experience of peace. We all have to deal with conflict and are affected by the process.  When the Wheel of Fortune is in this position, your circumstances may be constantly fluctuating. The changes are driven by a force no mortal can control. Your immediate future is so uncertain. No one can blame you for feeling a bit overwhelmed or confused. Still, you need not succumb to despair. The force in operation is the great washing machine of life. If you can put up with the churning, the rinse cycle and the final spin, then the end result will leave you restored, like new.  As with the wheel, what appears up will soon be down and vice versa. In the end, everything will be resolved. It is still a challenge to keep your composure in mid-cycle, however, because the part of you that prefers control feels helpless. Wait and watch from a quiet, meditative place inside yourself, and as you do so, try to absorb and understand the process. You'll be fine if you go with the flow.

The Winter of Listening   No one but me by the fire, my hands burning red in the palms while the night wind carries everything away outside.  All this petty worry while the great cloak of the sky grows dark and intense round every living thing.  What is precious inside us does not care to be known by the mind in ways that diminish its presence.  What we strive for in perfection is not what turns us into the lit angel we desire,  what disturbs and then nourishes has everything we need.  What we hate in ourselves is what we cannot know in ourselves but what is true to the pattern does not need to be explained.  Inside everyone is a great shout of joy waiting to be born.  Even with the summer so far off I feel it grown in me now and ready to arrive in the world.  All those years listening to those who had nothing to say.  All those years forgetting how everything has its own voice to make itself heard.  All those years forgetting how easily you can belong to everything simply by listening.  And the slow difficulty of remembering how everything is born from an opposite and miraculous otherness. Silence and winter has led me to that otherness.  So let this winter of listening be enough for the new life I must call my own.   ~  David Whyte

urlLink Workplace : "For INFPs the job search can be an opportunity to use their creativity, flexibility and their skills in self-expression. They can generate a variety of job possibilities, consider them for their ability to fulfill their values, and pursue them using their skills in communicating with others, either in writing or in person. Their idealism, commitment, flexibility and people skills will usually be communicated to others in the job search. Potential drawbacks for INFPs in the job search include unrealistic expectations for a job, feelings of inadequacy or lack of confidence, and inattention to details of the jobs or of the job search. Under stress, INFPs may become quite critical of others and themselves, and they may hold themselves back because they feel incompetent as they engage in this process. They can benefit from allowing their intuition to give them a new perspective on the possibilities available in the situation. They may also find it helpful to truly acknowledge their skills, as well as the importance of communicating those skills to others. In addition, INFPs can benefit from developing realistic expectations about the job search, and from objectively looking at the logical consequences of the various decisions they make. "

You may be needed to help with the transmission of sacred knowledge from the past into the future.   General meaning  Traditionally known as the Hierophant, this card refers to a Master and the learning of practical lessons from the study of Natural Law. This energy of this card points to some agent or resource that can reveal the secrets of life, the cycles of the moon and tides, the links between human beings and the heavens.   Because monasteries were the only places a person could learn to read and write in the middle ages, a Hierophant was one to whom a student would petition for entry. He was the one to set the curriculum for the neophyte's course of study.   Often pictured with the right hand raised in blessing, the Hierophant is linked with the ancient lineage of Melchezidek, initiator of the Hebrew priestly tradition, the one who passes on the teachings. All shamans of any tradition draw upon this archetype.

urlLink From the College of Christ Consciousness :  ABOUT FEAR  There are 3 universal fears: (1) abandonment (2) not feeling worthy or good enough (3) loss of trust which = fear of surrender  "Any time there is a fear, it will fall into one or more of these categories.  Each of us is born with one of these three being our core lesson to master in this lifetime.  All of our issues, no matter what they are and no matter how they came about, are related to, and can be traced back to, this core fear.   I will continue to create the same kind of situations, I will keep myself in judgement, I will reinforce the lower vibrational state of thinking that it's someone else's fault, and I will keep myself in the perception of being victimized until I resolve my own fear program and learn a new perception, a new way of thinking. Fear is only a mask of my true desire."  This belief system kicks ass. There are all kinds of exercises on the web site on how to get over yourself and create the reality you want - not in the cheesy way so many self-help shmoes are doing it, but in a straight forward manner that makes sense and can be practiced.

"Every new beginning is beautiful, filled with extraordinary opportunities, like a door opening on a whole new life. In beginnings there is a childlike innocence, and this innocence is filled with humility, filled with patience. On the spiritual path, these two virtues are paramount: humility and patience. To a beginner they are readily available.  A beginner knows he doesn't know, so there is humility. A beginner knows for certain something is going to happen, so there is patience. With humility and patience as his support, a beginner advances into the unknown to discover a glorious event yet to occur.  Even after achieving the goal of all spiritual practices, you cannot be indifferent to a new beginning. A beginning is forever full of magic, enchantment, and treasures to be explored. No matter what the occasion, a new beginning must be approached with a mystical awareness of its potential."  - Swami Chidvilasanda
Wage Peace   Wage peace with your breath. Breathe in firemen and rubble, breathe out whole buildings and flocks of redwing blackbirds.  Breathe in terrorists and breathe out sleeping children and freshly mown fields. Breathe in confusion and breathe out maple trees. Breathe in the fallen and breathe out lifelong friendships intact.  Wage peace with your listening: hearing sirens, pray loud. Remember your tools: flower seeds, clothes pins, clean rivers.  Make soup. Play music, learn the word for thank you in three languages. Learn to knit, and make a hat. Think of chaos as dancing raspberries, imagine grief as the outbreath of beauty or the gesture of fish. Swim for the other side. Wage peace.  Never has the world seemed so fresh and precious. Have a cup of tea and rejoice. Act as if armistice has already arrived. Don't wait another minute.  ~ Mary Oliver

urlLink Kundalini Poetry : SURVIVAL GUIDE (for Dan) by El Collie  You get through the ravages of Kundalini awakening the same way people from time immemorial survived all appointments with destiny (birth, irreparable loss, old age, death). You learn to tough it out. You learn to accept. You learn to surrender. You learn to lean into the arms of grace both unseen, from the realms above, and extended through a human hand. You get through tattered and torn around the edges. You get through wondering how you've managed to make it through this far. You get through hanging on for dear life. You get through shaken and shuddering and sheared of everything but your quivering mind and quaking heart, and the distant echo of a memory that this was why you came here. Though you think there has been some colossal mistake, inscrutably, incredibly, something in you knows that this is precisely what you came here so valiantly to endure: this merciless nakedness of heart and soul.

urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : "Now is the moment to be a bungee jumper without the cord! And it is this quality of absolute trust, with no reservations or secret safety nets, that the Knight of Water demands from us.   There is a tremendous sense of exhilaration if we can take the jump and move into the unknown, even if the idea scares us to death. And when we take trust to the level of the quantum leap, we don't make any elaborate plans or preparations. We don't say, 'Okay, I trust that I know what to do now, and I'll settle my things and pack my suitcase and take it with me.' No, we just jump, with hardly a thought for what happens next. The leap is the thing, and the thrill of it as we free-fall through the empty sky. "
urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : "Every moment in life we have a choice whether to enter life's waters and float, or to try to swim upstream.

Allow this feeling of trust and relaxation to grow more and more; everything is happening exactly as it should."

urlLink CHINESE ART  AND GREEK ART  by Rumi  The Prophet said, 'There are some who see me by the same light in which I am seeing them. Our natures are one.  Without references to any strands of lineage, without refrences to texts or traditions, we drink the life-water together.'  Here's a story about that hidden mystery:  The Chinese and the Greeks were arguing  as to who were the better artists.  The king said,   'We'll settle this matter with a debate.'  The Chinese began talking, but the Greeks wouldn't say anything. They left.  The Chinese suggested then that they each be given  a room to work on with their artistry, two rooms facing each other and divided by a curtain.  The Chinese asked the king for a hundred colors, all the variations, and each morning they came to where the dyes were kept and took them all.  The Greeks took no colors.   'They are not part of our work.' They went to their room and began cleaning and polishing the walls.  All day every day they made those walls as pure and clear as an open sky.  There is a way that leads from all-colors to colorlessness. Know that the magnificent variety  of the clouds and the weather comes from the total simplicity of the sun and the moon.  The Chinese finished, and they were so happy. They beat the drums in the joy of completion.  The king entered the room, astonished by the gorgeous color and detail.  The Greeks then pulled the curtain dividing the rooms. The Chinese figures and images shimmeringly reflected on the clear Greek walls. They lived there, even more beautifully, and always changing in the light.  The Greek art is the sufi way. They don't study books of philosophical thought.  They make their loving clearer and clearer. No wantings, no anger. In that purity they receive and reflect the images of every moment, from here, from the stars, from the void.  They take them in as though they were seeing with the lighted clarity that sees them.  In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems.  You dance inside my chest, where no one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that sight becomes this art.  Drumsound rises on the air, its throb, my heart.  A voice inside that beats says,   "I know you are tired,   but come. This is the way."  Are you jealous of the ocean's generosity? Why would you refuse to give this joy to anyone? Fish don't hold the sacred liquid in cups! They swim the huge fluid freedom.
Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front (excerpt)   Ask the questions that have no answers.  Invest in the millennium. Plant sequoias.  Say that your main crop is the forest  that you did not plant,  that you will not live to harvest. Say that the leaves are harvested  when they have rotted into the mold. Call that profit. Prophesy such returns.  Put your faith in the two inches of humus  that will build under the trees  every thousand years.   Listen to carrion -- put your ear  close, and hear the faint chattering  of the songs that are to come.  Expect the end of the world. Laugh.  Laughter is immeasurable. Be joyful  though you have considered all the facts.  So long as women do not go cheap  for power, please women more than men. Ask yourself: Will this satisfy  a woman satisfied to bear a child?  Will this disturb the sleep  of a woman near to giving birth?   Go with your love to the fields.  Lie down in the shade. Rest your head  in her lap. Swear allegiance  to what is highest your thoughts. As soon as the generals and the politicos  can predict the motions of your mind,  lose it. Leave it as a sign  to mark the false trail, the way  you didn't go. Be like the fox  who makes more tracks than necessary,  some in the wrong direction.  Practice resurrection. ~ Wendell Berry   urlLink web version from panhala

urlLink Free I-Ching Reading :: I-Ching.com :: Oracle of Changes :  "After a thunderstorm, or any period of extreme tension, a period of new clarity and fresh opportunity follows. The storm has the effect of clearing the air and suddenly reducing atmospheric tension. Deliverance is at hand. In the wake of a storm on land, deliverance appears in the form of new color and life, which bursts forth in all the fields and flowers. In the wake of a storm at sea, deliverance takes the form of land itself.  In the field of human relations, the rain of forgiveness washes the human landscape clean after a period of enmity and error. Great clarity of purpose and renewed vigor can follow the healing of old wounds. But care must be taken not to re-open these old wounds by moving too quickly. In the same way, it is important to return to normalcy first before moving ahead with new plans after periods of stress.  Following the resolution of a difficult situation, your first priority, should be to return to normal conditions as quickly as possible. Breathe a sigh of relief, but don't relax completely. It would be a mistake to re-awaken the sleeping dogs of the immediate past before the new situation has crystallized. Look ahead. Attend to any residual matters that need resolution, and do so as quickly as possible. Make a clean sweep of the past, move deliberately, and the future will bring good fortune."

Introductions   Some of what we love  we stumble upon -  a purse of gold thrown on the road,  a poem, a friend, a great song.

And more  comes to us, carried  as carefully  as a bright cup of water,  as new bread.  ~ Moya Cannon (The Parchment Boat, 1997)
"At the new moon, the lunar gravity pulls water up, and causes the seeds to swell and burst. This factor, coupled with the increasing moonlight creates balanced root and leaf growth. This is the best time for planting above ground annual crops that produce their seeds outside the fruit. Examples are lettuce, spinach, celery, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and grain crops. Cucumbers like this phase also, even though they are an exception to that rule.  In the second quarter the gravitational pull is less, but the moonlight is strong, creating strong leaf growth. It is generally a good time for planting, especially two days before the full moon. The types of crops that prefer the second quarter are annuals that produce above ground, but their seeds form inside the fruit, such as beans, melons, peas, peppers, squash, and tomatoes. Mow lawns in the first or second quarter to increase growth.  After the full moon, as the moon wanes, the energy is drawing down. The gravitation pull is high, creating more moisture in the soil, but the moonlight is decreasing, putting energy into the roots. This is a favorable time for planting root crops, including beets, carrots, onions, potatoes, and peanuts. It is also good for perennials, biennials, bulbs and transplanting because of the active root growth. Pruning is best done in the third quarter, in the sign of Scorpio.  In the fourth quarter there is decreased gravitational pull and moonlight, and it is considered a resting period. This is also the best time to cultivate, harvest, transplant and prune. Mow lawns in the third or fourth quarter to retard growth."  urlLink More on gardening by the moon phases...
urlLink HOSPICE of North Central Florida : Why do you want to be a Hospice volunteer?  There are two reasons I want to work as a Hospice volunteer.

I believe volunteering is an imporant first step for me in defining which direction I will take to do this.  Second, I feel I am ready and capable of being a support to people in Hospice. I experienced two losses which were eased by Hospice in Broward County. The Hospice workers gave incredible care to both of my grandmothers as they were approaching life's end and the volunteers who were there played a critical role. I will always remember the support one of the volunteers gave to my mother during that time just by being there to talk to her.   To sum it all up, I want to give back. I want to do it with my career and I want to start now.  Thank you for asking this question.

Remove the old tube.  Inflate the new tube slightly. (Just enough to give it shape.)  Put the new tube inside the tire and insert the valve into the valve hole of the rim.  Mount the other side of the tire on the rim. It is best to only use your thumbs, but you may need to use tire levers.  Partially inflate the tire and check that the bead is evenly seated around the rim.  Inflate the tire to recommended pressure.  Put the wheel back on the bike and ride.

urlLink What makes people ticklish? :  Dear Yahoo!: What makes people ticklish? Arden Dallas, Texas   Dear Arden: Being ticklish is a complicated trait rooted in our evolutionary past. Two searches, 'physiology + ticklish' and 'why are we ticklish,' turned up a number of articles that helped us understand this touchy, feely human feature.   Scientists suggest that being ticklish is our defense against creepy crawlies like spiders and bugs, a physiological response alerting us to a specific type of threat. That is why vulnerable parts of our bodies -- feet, chest, and armpits, are among the most ticklish.   While there is no question that being ticklish is neurological, scientists contend that it is also learned. One theory sees ticklishness as a personality-based response to perceived attack. Antsy folks may laugh uncontrollably at the lightest touch, or even without being touched at all, while folks made of sterner stuff won't budge during more aggressive tickle attacks.   If you close your eyes and try to remain calm while you are tickled, you can decrease panic, reduce giggles, and dull sensation. And, no matter how hard you try, it is nearly impossible to tickle yourself.   Tickling satisfies our human need to touch. Robert R. Provine, a professor of neuroscience and author of Quest for Laughter, sees the tickle as a form of communication between friends, family, and lovers, playing a key role in the evolution of social and sexual behavior. He points to chimps tickling each other during play, parents tickling little kids, and lovers tickling each other affectionately.   'If you think the social component is not important,' Provine says, 'Try tickling a stranger.'

urlLink Osho Zen Tarot :  Friendliness  First meditate, be blissful, then much love will happen of its own accord. Then being with others is beautiful and being alone is also beautiful. Then it is simple, too. You don't depend on others and you don't make others dependent on you. Then it is always a friendship, a friendliness. It never becomes a relationship, it is always a relatedness. You relate, but you don't create a marriage. Marriage is out of fear, relatedness is out of love. You relate; as long as things are moving beautifully, you share. And if you see that the moment has come to depart because your paths separate at this crossroad, you say good-bye with great gratitude for all that the other has been to you, for all the joys and all the pleasures and all the beautiful moments that you have shared with the other. With no misery, with no pain, you simply separate. - Osho The White Lotus Chapter 10  The branches of these two flowering trees are intertwined, and their fallen petals blend together on the ground in their beautiful colors. It is as if heaven and earth are bridged by love. But they stand individually, each rooted in the soil in their own connection with the earth. In this way they represent the essence of true friends, mature, easy with each other, natural. There is no urgency about their connection, no neediness, no desire to change the other into something else. This card indicates a readiness to enter this quality of friendliness. In the passage, you may notice that you are no longer interested in all kinds of dramas and romances that other people are engaged in. It is not a loss. It is the birth of a higher, more loving quality born of the fullness of experience. It is the birth of a love that is truly unconditional, without expectations or demands.

urlLink Rare white buffalo born in Arizona :  "Things have been hopping lately at the Spirit Mountain Ranch, 20 miles north of Flagstaff on Highway 180. Three baby bison were born in five days, culminating in the birth of Sunrise Spirit, a full-white female Saturday. Two other bison, both reddish brown, were born earlier in the month. One male, Wind Dancer, was born during such strong winds that he could barely stand.   The birth of a white buffalo is very meaningful to many Native Americans, who hold that white buffalo are sacred and will return during a period of disaster in the world. Plains Lakota lore says the birth of a female white buffalo heralds a time of enlightenment and healing, bringing all races together in peace, balance and harmony."
urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : Moment To Moment The past is no more and the future is not yet: both are unnecessarily moving in directions which don't exist. One used to exist, but no longer exists, and one has not even started to exist. The only right person is one who lives moment to moment, whose arrow is directed to the moment, who is always here and now; wherever he is, his whole consciousness, his whole being, is involved in the reality of here and in the reality of now. That's the only right direction. Only such a man can enter into the golden gate. The present is the golden gate. Here-now is the golden gate. ...And you can be in the present only if you are not ambitious--no accomplishment, no desire to achieve power, money, prestige, even enlightenment, because all ambition leads you into the future. Only a non-ambitious man can remain in the present. A man who wants to be in the present has not to think, has just to see and enter the gate. Experience will come, but experience has not to be premeditated. Osho The Great Zen Master Ta Hui Chapter 37  Commentary:  As this figure moves across the stones, he steps lightly and non-seriously, and at the same time absolutely balanced and alert. Behind the swirling, ever-changing waters we can see the shapes of buildings; there appears to be a city in the background. The man is in the marketplace but at the same time outside of it, maintaining his balance and able to watch it from above. This card challenges us to move away from our preoccupations with other spaces and other times, and stay alert to what is happening in the here and now. Life is a great ocean in which you can play if you drop all your judgments, your preferences and the attachment to the details of your long-term plans. Be available to what comes your way, as it comes. And don't worry if you stumble or fall; just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, have a good laugh, and carry on.

urlLink the truth  ADVERTISING IDEA  I started smoking when I was 15. I am now 33 . I've made numerous attempts to quit smoking but at some point, maybe a day or a year later, I find myself at a convenience store or gas station buying cigarettes and getting hooked again. I always get a pack of matches for free along with the pack. My story is the same as tens of thousands of other smokers.   If you really want to make a difference, please start distributing your anti-smoking advertising on match books. A diseased lung on a pack of free matches would be a chilling image that could help get ex-smokers who fell off the wagon back on again.   Thank you!

Cancer Horoscope  Your skin may not be able to contain you now, as it feels like you are ready to shed whatever is now holding you back. As a snake outgrows its skin, you, too, have moved beyond the teachers and authorities that have brought you this far. But you're not going to escape without first finishing what you've started.     urlLink General Daily Overview  The Moon enters Aries, the first sign of the zodiac, at 6:02 am EDT -- thus beginning the cycle anew as it does every month. We feel the need to initiate action, to act on new feelings, to tackle a new project and in general, to jump in to circumstances before we know the consequences. Additionally, the Moon in Aries forms a tense square with Mars in Cancer, making us struggle with the question of action versus inaction. We feel ready to express our feelings, yet we tend to hold something back, as if our survival depended on it.
The Seven Of Pentacles -- Marge Piercy  Under a sky the color of pea soup she is looking at her work growing away there actively, thickly like grapevines or pole beans as things grow in the real world, slowly enough. If you tend them properly, if you mulch, if you water, if you provide birds that eat insects a home and winter food, if the sun shines and you pick off caterpillars, if the praying mantis comes and the ladybugs and the bees, then the plants flourish, but at their own internal clock.  Connections are made slowly, sometimes they grow underground. You cannot tell always by looking what is happening. More than half the tree is spread out in the soil under your feet. Penetrate quietly as the earthworm that blows no trumpet. Fight persistently as the creeper that brings down the tree. Spread like the squash plant that overruns the garden. Gnaw in the dark and use the sun to make sugar.  Weave real connections, create real nodes, build real houses. Live a life you can endure: Make love that is loving. Keep tangling and interweaving and taking more in, a thicket and bramble wilderness to the outside but to us interconnected with rabbit runs and burrows and lairs.  Live as if you liked yourself, and it may happen: reach out, keep reaching out, keep bringing in. This is how we are going to live for a long time: not always, for every gardener knows that after the digging, after the planting, after the long season of tending and growth, the harvest comes.  ~ Marge Piercy

urlLink Neurology (general): Eye twitch   Question: I was trying to find out why I have been having a constant twitching in my left eyelid. It is quite visable and extremely annoying. Any answers would be appreciated. Thanks.  Answer: Twitching of the eye almost always occurs in the muscles of the eyelid. Because they press on the eye it may feel as though the eyeball itself is moving Minor eyelid twitches require no treatment as they usually resolve spontaneously. Reducing stress, using warm soaks, in some cases it occurs because of irritation in the eye, which results in twitching of the eyelid. However, if the eye is comfortable it is more likely that it is a simple muscle spasm, which may be related to stress or fatigue or in, many cases happen spontaneously without any known cause. Eye Twitching should resolve on its own it does not it certainly is worth a comprehensive eye examination to ensure that no other problem is occurring in the eye.

Why does the world seem to be getting more fucked up every week?   urlLink Harper's Weekly Review (Harpers.org) :  "Six American soldiers, including a general, were facing court martial over the torture and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison, which was famous for its torture chambers under Saddam Hussein. Photographs of the abuse were broadcast on U.S. television; one image depicted a hooded prisoner standing on a box with wires attached to his genitals. Other photos showed prisoners masturbating; several showed U.S. soldiers smiling and posing next to their victims. Some of the soldiers blamed mercenaries for the abuses; others said that military intelligence was in control of that cellblock. Photographs were published of British troops beating an Iraqi man and urinating on him; the pictures also showed a soldier striking the man in the genitals with a rifle; the victim's jaw was reportedly broken and his teeth were smashed before he was thrown off the back of a moving truck. President Bush condemned the abuse. "Their treatment does not reflect the nature of the American people," he said. "That's not the way we do things in America."   The Urban Institute released a study showing that in some U.S. counties 30 percent of the population is in prison, and an abortion provider in Kansas City was accused of practicing fetal cannibalism. The United States used F-15E and F-16 warplanes, F-14 and F-18 fighter-bombers, AC-130 gunships, and AH-1W Super Cobra helicopters to bomb Fallujah. British Tornados were also used. Some three dozen laser-guided 500-pound bombs were dropped, and at least one building was blown up by accident. A Cobra helicopter fired a missile at a mosque and knocked over its minaret. U.S. forces, fearing a public relations disaster, pulled back from the city and left a new Iraqi force in charge under the command of General Jasim Muhammad Saleh, who served in the Republican Guard under Saddam Hussein. There was some confusion among American officials, however, as to whether the general was really in charge and whether he had actually served in the Republican Guard. Iraq's Governing Council unveiled a new national flag that was immediately condemned for its strong resemblance to the flag of Israel, which features the same shade of blue.  "Brother Guide" Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya arrived in Brussels, along with his white stretch Mercedes limo and four female bodyguards wearing tight uniforms, to meet with European officials. He called on the United States and China to rid themselves of nuclear and chemical weapons. "Hopefully," he said, "nothing will force us to go back to the days when we used our cars and explosive belts." Terrorists in Syria fought with police and blew up a bomb outside a former United Nations office in Damascus, and militants in Saudi Arabia attacked the offices of a Western engineering company and killed several people; one American engineer was dragged away behind a car. The United Nations Security Council voted to ban "non-state actors" from possessing nuclear weapons. Police killed more than 100 Muslim militants armed with machetes in southern Thailand. Vandals defaced 127 graves with swastikas and other Nazi symbols in a Jewish cemetery in Alsace, and the Anti-Defamation League released a report showing that European anti-Semitism is on the decline, though negative attitudes toward Israel are up. The Likud Party, in a referendum, rejected Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to withdraw unilaterally from the Gaza Strip, where a pregnant Israeli woman and her four daughters, ages two to 11, were murdered by Palestinian gunmen. Child abductions were on the rise in Afghanistan, and the United Nations was having a hard time recruiting peacekeepers for its mission in Haiti.  President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney met for several hours with the 9/11 commission, though they refused to permit the interview to be recorded or transcribed; two Democratic members of the commission had to leave early because they had other appointments. It was reported that more than $5 billion in antiterrorism money for local governments and agencies has been held up by red tape, and that last year the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control assigned only four employees to work on terrorist cases; in contrast, almost two dozen were investigating violations of the Cuban embargo. Since 1990, the office has opened 93 investigations into terrorist finances and 10,683 relating to Cuba. President Bush declined to investigate China's unfair trade practices, and ten new countries joined the European Union. Bosnian Serb officials revealed six new mass graves containing victims of the Srebrenica massacre.  California banned Diebold's electronic voting machines, and experts said that the United States is losing its dominance in science and technology. Scientists developed a type of computer made of DNA that they hope could someday diagnose and treat diseases from inside the particular human cells that require treatment. SARS continued to spread in China. Researchers discovered a molecule, used by some cancer tumors, that prevents cells from dying. Archaeologists found an underground Egyptian maze filled with mummies, and scientists discovered that women tend to marry men who look like their fathers.

urlLink Abandoned Whizhost customer FAQ    Due to the overwhelming number of questions generated by former Whizhost customers,  PLEASE look for answers here rather than asking by e-mail.   Q  Could you let me know when my website that were hosted by Whizhost will be back on-line, and if there is anything I need to do?    A  According to the correspondence we have had with Whizhost, they have abandoned their customers. If you need immediate account set-up send a message to migration@sb-host.com   Q  Do you have any information on why they have disappeared?    A  You will find current information on our forums   Q  What are the chances of getting my Whizhost accts restored? And what about backups? I have clients with databases etc on their Whizhost-hosted account and they need to retrieve the data from them. Also, retrieve emails. What are the chances of this and what timeframe are we looking at.     A  Sorry restoration and/or backups are unlikely. You will find current information on our forums   Q  Will we still be able to host free of charge for the rest of the contract we had at Whizhost?    A  Sorry. we are unable to provide free hosting.   Q  We had 8 domains hosted on the Whizhost server. Will it be possible to continue with this kind of a multiple domain hosting plan?   A  We have adopted 2 new  flexible  packages that will provide similar features, QUALITY support, and competitive prices.  contact us if you have special needs   Q  I am also wondering if you have contact information for Whizhost?    A  You will find current information on our forums   Q  Will any data be recovered from Whizhost?    A  You will find current information on our forums   Q  Has all of our site data been lost, or should we anticipate full recovery, and if so... when?   A  You will find current information on our forums   Q  I had 9 accounts and 9 domains with Whizhost, I just paid them last week 300.00 for 2 years more of hosting, how do I get my money back    A  You will find current information on our forums   Q  Is the $140.00 for hosting starting now, or after my term expires with Whizhost?    A  Your billing period will begin 14 days following your account migration We wish we could do more,  but we're forced to limit our Whizhost "victims" offering due to the overwhelming abuse that Whizhost has imposed. This should provide ample time to decide what you want to do. We HOPE you'll consider staying with us.    Q  I have 2 reseller accounts with Whizhost with unlimited mysql databases, unlimited emails accounts, 6000MB hard disk space and 20 domains. I understand you guys take the customers of Whizhost but I have my own customers and they are very angry with this situation. There are a lot of people involved in this trouble.    A  We understand your situation and are here to help. Unfortunately "Unlimited" anything  is not an option. We at SB-Host believe offering any type of  "Unlimited" services is unethical. If you have specific requirements, contact us. Our offerings are flexible.   Q  I would like a refund of my Whizhost fee\92s. This is all totally unacceptable, the MIGHT restore data? When I signed up it said 99.9% downtime and generators and backups and all that. Now your saying I have to set everything back up with some other company and MIGHT get my data. I don\92t have the data locally, so you just lost everything? Where are these \93backups\94 Please refund my monies for all service as I did not receive the service you promoted.    A  Sorry. We didn't take your money, nor did we make any promises we did not keep. Although paying more does not guarantee better service, in most cases deals that are "too good to be true," usually are. We believe Whizhost qualifies in the "too good to be true" category.  Q  I had a pre-paid Whizhost account, and I'm confused. Do I upload my files onto your server, or are they supposed to come back online?   A  Due to  the lack of cooperation by other "players" in this problem, We do not recommend waiting for the Whizhost server to come back online.   Q  Once all this is settled, we would like a refund of service as my customers are all finding other providers. This was all handled so unprofessional....    A  Refunds are unlikely.  "Unprofessional" is an understatement.

urlLink Discovery Health :: Quit Smoking: If You StoppedToday....  This site states that "a review of numerous research studies focusing on smoking cessation has concluded that while women may suffer greater relative risks of smoking-related diseases than do men, they tend to have more difficulty than men in quitting smoking."  I am sure all that's true but here are some good reasons to remember when the craving is bad (like it is right now).  Reproductive health: Women smokers are at higher risk for pregnancy complications, early menopause, infertility, miscarriage, pre-term delivery, stillbirth, infant death and having low birth-weight babies. Smoking also doubles a woman's risk of cervical cancer.   Children's health: Smoking increases the chances of sudden infant death syndrome, infant and perinatal deaths, learning disorders, attention deficit disorder and disruptive behavior. "If you bathe a fetus' brain in nicotine for nine months, it's clear there are profound effects," says Dr. Timothy McAfee, executive director for health promotion and disease prevention for Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound.   Hormones: Smoking causes women to enter menopause sooner and interrupts the menstrual cycle. "It's also well established that the aging process\97skin and wrinkles\97is substantially faster in women who smoke," McAfee adds.

urlLink Painting Over Plastic Laminate :  "Is there any way to paint over dark-brown plastic-laminate kitchen cabinets? I can't replace or reface them right now, and they're just too dark for the room. I'd appreciate any tips." - Lyndee, via e-mail  John says: If you're looking at ugly laminate, refacing it with not-so-ugly laminate is the best course of action, from the standpoint of durability and ease of care. But if it's paint you want, the answer to your question is yes, as long as the laminate is well-adhered and in good condition. First, I'd wipe down all the surfaces with a solvent such as xylol to get rid of dirt and grease. Be sure to don chemical-resistant gloves, wear a respirator, shut off any pilot lights, and kick out the dog - this is powerful stuff. Then scuff up all the surfaces with 150-grit sandpaper and wipe them down again with xylol. Next, you want a primer that will adhere tenaciously and serve as a good base for paint. The one I use comes from X-I-M, a company that manufactures bonding primers; they have several solvent-based products suitable for your application. I find that the spray-applied primer actually holds better than the brush-on version. Allow two or three days for the primer to cure before sanding it lightly with 220-grit paper.

Rush for surnames produces 500 Genghis Khans  By Oliver August  MONGOLIANS have been ordered to invent their own surnames, after generations of living with just one name on the orders of their former Soviet masters.  Hundreds, pondering what to call themselves, daily besiege a small office in the centre of their capital where identity documents are issued. Held back by armed guards outside, some opt for surnames like Seven Drunk Men that hint at Mongolia's national pastime.   Others prefer to adopt the name of Genghis Khan, still the mightiest of Mongols, who now has 500 namesakes in Ulan Bator.   When communism crumbled in 1990 the ban on family names was lifted but many nomadic herders who roam between Siberia and the Gobi desert continue to refer to each other only by single names.   Now, to fight incest and make official records more intelligible, the Government has set a deadline of June 27 for all 2.5 million Mongolians to choose a family name on pain of a fine equivalent to several months' salary.   "We are returning to our ancient traditions," the Defence Minister said. The result is a stampede to state registration offices by Mongolians wearing felt hats and embroidered riding boots.  urlLink more...

urlLink A GLASS OF MILK :  One day, a poor boy who was selling goods from door to door to pay his way through school, found he had only one thin dime left, and he was hungry. He decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry so brought him a large glass of milk.   He drank it slowly, and then asked, "How much do I owe  you?"  "You don't owe me anything," she replied. "Mother has taught us never to accept pay for a kindness."  He said..... "Then I thank you from my heart."  As Howard Kelly left that house, he not only felt stronger physically, but his faith in God and man was strong also. He had been ready to give up and quit. Many years later that same young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where they called in specialists to study her rare disease.  Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes.  Immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. Dressed in his doctor's gown he went in to see her. He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room determined to do his  best to save her life. From that day he gave special attention to her case. After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room. She feared  to open it, for she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for  it all. Finally she looked, and something caught her attention on the side  of the bill. She read these words....."Paid in full with one glass of milk"  (Signed) Dr. Howard Kelly Tears of joy flooded her eyes as her happy heart prayed: "Thank You, God, that Your love has spread abroad through human hearts and hands."   There's a saying which goes something like this: Bread cast on the waters comes back to you. The good deed you do today may benefit you or someone you love at the least expected time.

urlLink Warning: nicotine seriously improves health  Robin McKie, science editor Sunday July 18, 2004 The Observer   Nicotine could soon be rehabilitated as a treatment for schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as hyperactivity disorders.  Research shows that the chemical that has addicted millions to smoking has a powerful impact on brain activity in patients who suffer from psychiatric and degenerative disorders.   Some experiments have shown that nicotine can slow down the onset of Parkinson's symptoms; others have had revealed its power in curtailing the hallucinations of schizophrenics.   'A whole range of psychiatric conditions seem to be helped by nicotine,' said Dr Dan McGehee, a neurobiologist at the University of Chicago. 'However, such benefits do not justify smoking. The lethal effects of cigarettes far outweigh any help they provide. On the other hand, our research does suggest that derivatives of nicotine, administered medically, could help to alleviate a range of psychiatric problems.'   Nicotine is known to switch on receptors on the surface of cells in certain parts of the brain, causing these neurones to release the neuro-transmitter dopamine, a chemical that is associated with feelings of pleasure. This effect leads to a person's addiction.   More than 50 per cent of people suffering from clinical depression smoke, while the figure rises to 95 per cent for schizophrenics. But smoking among the general public has dropped to about 25 per cent. 'The assumption is that people with psychiatric conditions are self-medicating,' said McGehee. 'They are smoking because the nicotine in particularly helpful in alleviating their condition.'   This point is backed by Dr Tony George, of Yale University. 'Smoking is a marker for psychopathology,' he states in the current issue of the journal Nature Medicine.   Similarly, it has been found that nicotine can sometimes slow the debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's, a disease caused by the slow destruction of certain types of brain cells.   'Either nicotine stimulates other types of brain cells to compensate for the loss of the cells involved in Parkinson's, or it is somehow providing protection to remaining healthy Parkinson's cells,' said McGehee. 'Either way, the effect is noticeable.'

urlLink Installing Love  - Milpitas Mom's Favorite Jokes CS Rep: Can you install LOVE?  Customer: I can do that. I'm not very technical, but I think I am ready to install now. What do I do first?  CS Rep: The first step is to open your HEART. Have you located your HEART ma'am?  Customer: Yes I have, but there are several programs running right now. Is it okay to install while they are running?  CS Rep: What programs are running ma'am?  Customer: Let me see....I have PASTHURT.EXE, LOWESTEEM.EXE, GRUDGE.EXE,and RESENTMENT.COM running right now.  CS Rep: No problem. LOVE will automatically erase PASTHURT.EXE from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. LOVE will eventually overwrite LOWESTEEM.EXE with a module of its own called HIGHESTEEM.EXE. However, you have to completely turn off GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM. Those programs prevent LOVE from being properly installed. Can you turn those off ma'am?  Customer: I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how?  CS Rep: My pleasure. Go to your Start menu and invoke FORGIVENESS.EXE. Do this as many times as necessary until GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM have been completely erased.  Customer: Okay, I'm done. LOVE has started installing itself automatically. Is that normal?  CS Rep: Yes it is. You should receive a message that says it will reinstall for the life of your HEART. Do you see that message?  Customer: Yes I do. Is it completely installed?  CS Rep: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other HEARTS in order to get the upgrades.  Customer: Oops...I have an error message already. What should I do?  CS Rep: What does the message say?  Customer: It says "ERROR 412 - PROGRAM NOT RUN ON INTERNAL COMPONENTS." What does that mean?  CS Rep: Don't worry ma'am, that's a common problem. It means that the LOVE program is set up to run on external HEARTS but has not yet been run on your HEART. It is one of those complicated programming things, but in nontechnical terms it means you have to "LOVE" your own machine before it can "LOVE" others.  Customer: So what should I do?  CS Rep: Can you find the directory called "SELF-ACCEPTANCE"?  Customer: Yes, I have it.  CS Rep: Excellent, you are getting good at this.  Customer: Thank you.  CS Rep: You're welcome. Click on the following files and then copy them to the "MYHEART" directory: FORGIVESELF.DOC, SELFESTEEM.TXT, REALIZEWORTH.TXT, and GOODNESS.DOC. The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching any faulty programming. Also, you need to delete SELFCRITIC.EXE from all directories, and then empty your recycle bin afterwards to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back.  Customer: Got it. Hey! My HEART is filling up with really neat files. SMILE.MPG is playing on my monitor right now and it shows that WARMTH.COM, PEACE.EXE, and CONTENTMENT.COM are copying themselves all over my HEART!  CS Rep: Then LOVE is installed and running. You should be able to handle it from here. One more thing before I go...  Customer: Yes?  CS Rep: LOVE is freeware. Be sure to give it and its various modules to everybody you meet. They will in turn share it with other people and they will return some really neat modules back to you.  Customer: I will. Thank you for your help.

urlLink Free I-Ching Reading :: I-Ching.com :: Oracle of Changes : "When the light goes down, it may be wise to become invisible. The image is of fresh darkness, the period after the sun has gone down or the fire has gone out. There is still much activity left over from the light of day, and movements in the outer world are at their most dangerous. Even the smallest sound, the faintest glow of light, can attract unwanted attention.  When the darkness of stupidity reigns, it is best that your own brilliance stay 'hidden under a bushel basket.' That is, your thoughts and efforts should be quiet and self-contained, and protected, as much as possible, from harmful external influences.  Whatever you do, don't let yourself be swept along on the current of conventional wisdom when dangerous uncertainties exist. Try not to become too depressed or anxious; this period will pass. Just endure it for now and inwardly preserve your self-confidence, while outwardly remaining cooperative and flexible. The time to assert yourself will come. Avoid looking too far ahead if you have not yet achieved your goals. That only brings regret and longing, which can eat away at your inner resources.  Be cautious and reserved. Control yourself. Do not needlessly awaken dormant forces of opposition. During dark, unsettled periods, it is best to step gingerly around the sleeping dogs."

Stepping Westward (excerpt)   What is green in me darkens, muscadine.  If woman is inconstant, good, I am faithful to  ebb and flow, I fall in season and now  is a time of ripening. If her part  is to be true, a north star,  good, I hold steady in the black sky  and vanish by day, yet burn there  in blue or above quilts of cloud.  There is no savor more sweet, more salt  that to be glad to be what, woman,  and who, myself, I am, a shadow  that grows longer as the sun moves, drawn out  on a thread of wonder.  ~ Denise Levertov (Poems, 1960-1967)

urlLink Making Handmade Paper in 10 easy steps : Simple Recipe:   Many  types of paper  that can be used include:  Computer Paper (unprinted)  Newspaper (If you want a grayish colored paper)  Magazines  Egg Cartons  Old Cards (For heavier paper)  Toilet Paper  Paper Bags  Non Waxed Boxes (Pre-soak in warm water)  Office Paper  Tissue Paper (For finer paper)  Typing Paper  Napkins  Construction Paper    Supplies you'll need:   Sponge  Window Screening (mold)  Wood Frame (old picture frame can be used too) (deckle)  Plastic Basin/Tub (Large enough to totally immerse frame)  Blender/Food Processor (For making paper pulp)  White Felt or Flannel Fabric  Staples or Tacks (For tacking screen on frame)  Liquid starch (optional)    Instructions:   1. Select the pieces of paper to be recycled. You can even mix different types to create your own unique paper.  2. Rip the paper into small bits, and place into the blender. (about half full). Fill the blender with warm water. Run the blender slowly at first then increase the speed until the pulp looks smooth and well blended. ( 30 -40 seconds) Check that no flakes of paper remain. If there are, blend longer.  3. The next step is to make a mold. The mold, in this case, is made simply by stretching fiberglass screen (plain old door and window screen) over a wooden frame and stapling it. It should be as tight as possible.  4. Fill the basin about half way with water. Add 3 blender loads of pulp. (the more pulp you add the thicker the finished paper will be) Stir the mixture.  5. Now is the time to add the liquid starch for sizing.(This is not necessary but if the paper is going to be used for writing on, you should add some, the starch helps to prevent inks from soaking into the paper fibers.) Stir 2 teaspoons of liquid starch into the pulp.  Place the mold into the pulp and then level it out while it is submerged. Gently wiggle it side-to-side until the pulp on top of the screen looks even.  6. Slowly lift the mold up until it is above the level of the water. Wait until most of the water has drained from the new paper sheet. If the paper is very thick, remove some pulp from the tub. If it is too thin, add more pulp and stir the mixture again.  7. When the mold stops dripping, gently place one edge on the side of a fabric square (felt or flannel square). Gently ease the mold down flat, with the paper directly on the fabric. Use a sponge to press out as much water as possible. Wring the excess water from the sponge back into the large plastic tub.  8. Now comes the tricky part. Hold the fabric square flat and slowly lift the edge of the mold. The wet sheet of paper should remain on the fabric. If it sticks to the mold, you may have pulled to fast or not pressed out enough water. It takes a little practice. You can gently press out any bubbles and loose edges at this point.  9. Repeat the steps above, and stack the fabric squares on a cookie sheet. Save one fabric square to place on the top of the stack to cover the last piece of paper. Use another cookie sheet to press the remaining water out of the stack. (do this outside or in the bathtub, it can make a mess)  10. After you press the stack, gently separate the sheets. They can be dried by hanging on a clothesline or laying them out on sheets of newspaper. When they have dried peel them off the fabric and voila! you have paper!
